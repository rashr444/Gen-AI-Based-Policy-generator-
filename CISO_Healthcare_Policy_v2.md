-   --Prioritization:--  Risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact on the Organization, considering factors such as patient safety, financial exposure, and regulatory compliance.
-   --Mitigation:-- Based on the risk assessment, the Organization will develop and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks. Mitigation strategies may include technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems), administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training), and physical controls (e.g., access control to physical facilities).

--3. Data Protection--

The Organization is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data, including Protected Health Information (PHI), financial information, and other confidential business information.

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality, using a classification scheme that considers legal and regulatory requirements, business impact, and sensitivity.
-   --Data Encryption:--  Sensitive data (including PHI) will be encrypted both in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL) and at rest (e.g., using full-disk encryption, database encryption).  [Specify minimum encryption standards and algorithms].
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- The organization will implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control without authorization.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- The organization will maintain regular backups of critical data to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster or system failure. Backups will be stored in a secure offsite location.  Backup and recovery procedures will be tested regularly.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- The organization will adhere to established data retention policies and procedures. Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, in accordance with applicable regulations and industry best practices (e.g., shredding paper documents, securely wiping electronic storage devices).

--4. Access Controls--

Access to the Organization's information systems and data will be restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Account Management:--
    -   All users will be assigned unique user accounts.
    -   User accounts will be created, modified, and disabled promptly based on employment status and role changes.
    -   Default passwords will be changed immediately upon account creation.
-   --Password Management:--
    -   Users must create strong passwords that meet the Organization's password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, character types).
    -   Users are prohibited from sharing their passwords with others.
    -   Passwords should be changed periodically (e.g., every 90 days) or immediately if compromised.
    -   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems and applications.
-   --Access Control Lists (ACLs):--  ACLs will be implemented to restrict access to files, folders, and systems based on user roles and responsibilities.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the Organization's network will be secured using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with strong authentication, including MFA where appropriate.
-   --Physical Access:-- Physical access to the Organization's facilities and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel through the use of access badges, security cameras, and other physical security measures.

--5. Incident Response--

The Organization will maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
