Okay, here's a comprehensive cybersecurity policy tailored for a low-risk healthcare environment, incorporating the feedback and addressing HIPAA compliance.

--Cybersecurity Policy for [Healthcare Organization Name]--

--Version:-- 1.0
--Date:-- October 26, 2023
--Approved by:-- [Name], [Title]

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the standards and procedures that [Healthcare Organization Name] ("the Organization") implements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, business associates, and any other individuals or entities who have access to the Organization's information systems and data, regardless of their location.

The Organization is committed to maintaining a robust security posture that aligns with applicable laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.  This policy is designed to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data.

--2. Risk Assessment--

The Organization performs regular risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. The risk assessment process includes the following steps:

-   --Identification of Assets:--  Identification of all electronic and physical assets that store, process, or transmit ePHI.  This includes servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, network infrastructure, and paper records.
-   --Threat Identification:--  Identifying potential threats to ePHI, including internal threats (e.g., accidental disclosure, malicious insiders) and external threats (e.g., malware, phishing attacks, ransomware).
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Assessing vulnerabilities in the Organization's systems and processes that could be exploited by identified threats. This includes vulnerability scanning, penetration testing (as appropriate), and reviews of security configurations.
-   --Likelihood and Impact Analysis:-- Determining the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact on the Organization if such an event were to occur.  This will be based on the below "low-risk" determination.
-   --Risk Prioritization:--  Prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and impact.
-   --Mitigation Strategy Development:-- Developing and implementing mitigation strategies to address identified risks. This includes implementing technical safeguards (e.g., encryption, access controls), administrative safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, training), and physical safeguards (e.g., physical access controls, workstation security).
-   --Regular Review and Updates:-- Conducting regular reviews and updates of the risk assessment to account for changes in the threat landscape, the Organization's environment, and applicable laws and regulations.

--Low-Risk Environment Determination:--

The Organization's determination that it operates in a "low-risk environment" is based on the following criteria:

-   --Size and Complexity:--  The Organization is a [Describe size - e.g., small] practice with [Number] of employees and a relatively simple IT infrastructure.
-   --Data Volume:--  The volume of ePHI processed and stored is comparatively lower than larger healthcare organizations.
-   --Connectivity:-- Limited external connectivity with external systems and networks.
-   --Security Controls:-- Strong implementation of basic security controls, such as anti-malware software, firewalls, and access controls.
-   --No Prior Security Incidents:--  The Organization has not experienced any significant security incidents in the past [Timeframe].

-Notwithstanding the determination of a "low-risk environment," the Organization acknowledges that no environment is entirely risk-free, and ongoing monitoring, assessment, and adaptation of security measures are essential. Risk assessments will be reviewed at least annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to the Organization's environment (e.g., new technologies, changes in business operations).-

--3. Data Protection--

The Organization implements the following measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI and other sensitive data:

-   --Encryption:--
    -   All ePHI at rest (stored on computers, servers, mobile devices, and storage media) must be encrypted using an --Approved Encryption Solution--. An --Approved Encryption Solution-- is defined as:
        -   --For Devices:--  [Specify approved full disk encryption software, e.g., BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (macOS)]. Device encryption must be enabled and actively monitored by [Responsible Role/Department - e.g., IT Department].  IT will verify encryption status as part of the quarterly review.
        -   --For Data in Transit (e.g., email, file transfer):-- [Specify approved encryption protocols, e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher for email, SFTP or HTTPS for file transfer].
        -   --For Cloud Storage:-- [Specify approved cloud storage solution(s), e.g., HIPAA-compliant cloud storage providers] and ensure that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
    -   Encryption keys must be securely managed and protected from unauthorized access.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--  [If applicable, describe DLP measures; if not applicable in low-risk environment, state: "Due to the low-risk environment and limited data volume, formal DLP solutions are not currently implemented. However, data handling procedures are enforced through security awareness training and regular monitoring."]
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:--
    -   Regular backups of ePHI and other critical data are performed [Specify frequency - e.g., daily] and stored securely offsite or in a geographically separate location.
    -   Backup data is tested regularly to ensure it can be restored in a timely manner. [Specify testing frequency - e.g., quarterly].
    -   Backup and recovery procedures are documented and reviewed periodically.
-   --Data Sanitization and Disposal:--
    -   Data must be securely sanitized or destroyed before disposal of hardware or media.
