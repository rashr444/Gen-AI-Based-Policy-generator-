## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

**Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Applicable To:** All employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems and data.
**Compliance Standard:** ISO/IEC 27001

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the mandatory security requirements for [Organization Name], operating within a low-risk healthcare environment. This Policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient information and other sensitive data, in accordance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements, specifically aligned with ISO/IEC 27001.

This Policy aims to:

*   Establish a baseline level of security for all information assets.
*   Provide clear guidance to all personnel regarding their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment.
*   Minimize the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
*   Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.

While this policy is designed for a low-risk environment, it is crucial to understand that the healthcare industry inherently requires vigilance in data security. Regular review and updates of this Policy will be conducted to adapt to evolving threats and regulatory changes.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Organization Name] recognizes the importance of identifying and managing potential risks to its information assets. While this is a low-risk environment, we maintain a basic risk assessment process.

*   **Periodic Risk Assessment:** A basic risk assessment will be conducted at least annually to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities relevant to a low-risk setting. This includes considering factors such as physical security of the office, employee access to data, and the type of data stored.
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Identified risks will be assessed based on their potential impact (low, medium, high) and likelihood of occurrence (low, medium, high). Mitigation efforts will be prioritized for higher-impact and higher-likelihood risks.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Appropriate security controls will be implemented to mitigate identified risks. Examples include:
    *   Strong password requirements.
    *   Secure disposal of physical documents containing sensitive information.
    *   Limiting physical access to server rooms or areas containing sensitive information.
    *   Implementing basic firewall protection for network.

**3. Data Protection**

Protecting patient information and other sensitive data is paramount.  This section outlines the requirements for data protection:

*   **Data Classification:**  Data will be classified based on sensitivity.  For this low-risk environment, we utilize a simple classification system:
    *   **Confidential:** Patient medical records, financial data, and other information requiring strict confidentiality.
    *   **Internal:** Data used within the organization that is not publicly available.
    *   **Public:** Data that is publicly accessible.
*   **Data Storage:**  Confidential data must be stored securely.  This includes:
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit where feasible.
    *   Secure physical storage of paper documents.
    *   Properly sanitizing or destroying old hard drives and storage media before disposal.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data are essential to ensure business continuity in case of data loss. Backups will be stored securely and tested periodically to ensure recoverability.
*   **Data Disposal:** Data must be disposed of securely to prevent unauthorized access.  This includes shredding paper documents and securely wiping electronic media.
*   **Data Minimization:**  Only collect and retain data that is necessary for legitimate business purposes.  Review data retention policies regularly to ensure data is not kept longer than required.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to information systems and data must be restricted to authorized personnel only.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users will be granted access only to the data and systems they need to perform their job duties.
*   **User Account Management:**
    *   Unique user accounts must be created for each individual accessing the systems.
    *   Default passwords must be changed immediately upon account creation.
    *   User accounts will be disabled promptly upon termination of employment or change in job duties.
*   **Password Management:**
    *   Strong passwords are required (at least 8 characters, including a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols).
    *   Passwords must be changed regularly (at least every 90 days).
    *   Password reuse is prohibited.
*   **Physical Access:** Physical access to facilities and server rooms will be restricted to authorized personnel.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Where feasible, multi-factor authentication should be implemented for critical systems and data access.

**5. Incident Response**

An incident response plan is crucial for effectively handling security incidents and minimizing their impact.

*   **Incident Reporting:** All suspected security incidents (e.g., suspected malware infection, unauthorized access, data breaches) must be reported immediately to the designated incident response team (e.g., IT Manager or a designated security contact).
*   **Incident Classification:** Incidents will be classified based on their severity and potential impact.
*   **Incident Response Procedures:** The incident response plan will outline the steps to be taken in response to different types of incidents, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Regular Testing:** The incident response plan will be tested periodically through tabletop exercises or simulations to ensure its effectiveness.
*   **Documentation:** All security incidents and the corresponding response actions must be documented.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training is essential for educating employees about security risks and their responsibilities in protecting information.

*   **Initial Training:** All new employees will receive security awareness training upon hire.
*   **Annual Training:**  All employees will receive annual security awareness training.
*   **Training Content:**  Training will cover topics such as:
    *   Data security best practices.
    *   Password security.
    *   Phishing awareness.
    *   Social engineering awareness.
    *   Incident reporting procedures.
    *   Compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA privacy and security rules).
*   **Training Records:** Records of employee training will be maintained.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards is essential.

*   **Regulatory Compliance:** [Organization Name] will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).
*   **Policy Enforcement:**  This Policy will be enforced through appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment.
*   **Internal Audits:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this Policy and identify areas for improvement.
*   **External Audits:** [Organization Name] may be subject to external audits by regulatory agencies or other third parties.
*   **ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment:** While aiming for alignment, formal certification is not mandatory in this low-risk environment.  However, this policy is written considering the control objectives and guidelines within ISO/IEC 27001, providing a framework for continuous improvement in information security management.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient information and other sensitive data within [Organization Name]. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems and data are responsible for adhering to the requirements outlined in this Policy. This Policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness in protecting our information assets.  By adhering to this policy, we collectively contribute to a safer and more secure healthcare environment.

**Policy Review:**

This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed to address changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.
