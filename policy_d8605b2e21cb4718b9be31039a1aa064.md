## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environments

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Review Date:** [Date - Annually]
**Approved by:** [Name of Approving Authority - e.g., CEO, Board of Directors]

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum acceptable cybersecurity standards for [Organization Name], operating within a low-risk healthcare environment. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data, ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including ISO/IEC 27001. While acknowledging the low-risk profile, this policy establishes a foundational security posture to mitigate potential threats and maintain a secure operating environment. All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or handle [Organization Name]'s information systems and data are required to adhere to this policy.

**2. Risk Assessment**

2.1. **Purpose:** To identify, assess, and prioritize cybersecurity risks to the organization's assets, systems, and data.

2.2. **Methodology:** A simplified risk assessment will be conducted annually, focusing on identifying readily apparent vulnerabilities and common threats. This assessment will consider factors such as:

    *   The nature of the data processed and stored.
    *   The potential impact of a security breach on patient care, financial stability, and reputation.
    *   The likelihood of various threat scenarios occurring.
    *   Existing security controls and their effectiveness.

2.3. **Scope:** The risk assessment will encompass all information systems, applications, and network infrastructure used to process, store, or transmit PHI and other sensitive data.

2.4. **Mitigation:** Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood. Appropriate mitigation measures, proportionate to the risk level, will be implemented. These measures may include:

    *   Implementing basic security controls, as outlined in subsequent sections of this policy.
    *   Applying software patches and updates promptly.
    *   Monitoring system logs for suspicious activity.

2.5. **Documentation:** The risk assessment process, findings, and mitigation plans will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.

**3. Data Protection**

3.1. **Data Classification:** Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and regulatory requirements. At a minimum, data will be classified as either "Restricted" (PHI, sensitive personal information) or "Public" (information available to the general public).

3.2. **Data Storage:** Restricted data must be stored securely on encrypted devices or in encrypted databases. Data at rest encryption is highly recommended.

3.3. **Data Transmission:** All electronic transmission of Restricted data, both internally and externally, must be encrypted using secure protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, or secure email.

3.4. **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of all critical data will be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. Backup data will be tested periodically to ensure recoverability in the event of a disaster or data loss event.

3.5. **Data Disposal:** When data is no longer needed, it must be securely disposed of using methods that prevent unauthorized access or recovery. This includes securely wiping hard drives, shredding paper documents containing PHI, and securely deleting electronic files.

**4. Access Controls**

4.1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will only be granted access to the information and resources they need to perform their job duties.

4.2. **User Authentication:** Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended for accessing sensitive systems and data.

4.3. **Account Management:** User accounts will be promptly created, modified, or terminated as required. Periodic reviews of user access privileges will be conducted to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

4.4. **Remote Access:** Remote access to the organization's network and systems will be secured using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or other secure access methods.

4.5. **Physical Security:** Access to physical facilities and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Security measures such as locks, surveillance cameras, and access control systems will be implemented to protect against unauthorized physical access.

**5. Incident Response**

5.1. **Incident Definition:** A security incident is any event that compromises or threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or data.

5.2. **Reporting:** All suspected security incidents must be reported immediately to [Designated Incident Response Contact/Team].

5.3. **Response Procedures:** A basic incident response plan will be developed and maintained, outlining the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident. The plan will include:

    *   Incident identification and classification.
    *   Containment and eradication of the incident.
    *   Recovery of affected systems and data.
    *   Post-incident analysis and documentation.

5.4. **Communication:** Clear communication channels will be established to ensure timely and effective communication during a security incident.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

6.1. **Training Requirements:** All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or handle [Organization Name]'s information systems and data are required to complete annual security awareness training.

6.2. **Training Content:** The training will cover topics such as:

    *   Basic cybersecurity principles.
    *   Phishing awareness and prevention.
    *   Password security best practices.
    *   Data protection policies and procedures.
    *   Incident reporting procedures.

6.3. **Reinforcement:** Ongoing security awareness reminders and updates will be provided to reinforce key concepts and promote a security-conscious culture.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

7.1. **Compliance:** This policy is designed to align with relevant laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including ISO/IEC 27001.

7.2. **Auditing:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement. Audit findings will be documented and addressed in a timely manner.

7.3. **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or organizational environment.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy represents a commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within [Organization Name]. By adhering to the principles and guidelines outlined in this policy, we can collectively mitigate cybersecurity risks and maintain a secure and reliable operating environment. All personnel are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.
