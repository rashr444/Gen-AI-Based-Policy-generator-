## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environments

**Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Effective Date:** November 26, 2023
**Policy Owner:** [Your Name], CISO

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security requirements and guidelines for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within this organization. This policy is specifically tailored for environments categorized as "Low Risk," meaning they handle a limited volume of PHI, utilize primarily cloud-based services with built-in security features, and have a restricted number of users accessing sensitive data. This policy is aligned with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard and serves as a foundation for establishing and maintaining a secure operating environment. All employees, contractors, and any other individuals with access to organizational information systems are required to adhere to this policy.

**2. Risk Assessment**

While classified as a Low Risk environment, periodic risk assessments are still crucial.

*   **Frequency:** Risk assessments will be conducted at least annually or whenever significant changes occur within the organization's IT infrastructure, business processes, or regulatory landscape.
*   **Scope:** The risk assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to information assets, considering factors such as data storage locations, access controls, and software applications.
*   **Methodology:** A simplified risk assessment methodology will be employed, focusing on identifying and prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This may involve using a qualitative approach, such as a risk matrix, to categorize risks (e.g., low, medium, high).
*   **Documentation:** Risk assessment findings, including identified risks, their potential impact, and implemented mitigation measures, will be documented and reviewed by management.
*   **Mitigation:** Identified risks will be addressed through the implementation of appropriate security controls, as outlined in this policy.

**3. Data Protection**

Data protection is paramount to maintaining patient privacy and regulatory compliance.

*   **Data Classification:**  Data will be classified according to its sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential).  PHI is considered "Confidential" and must be protected accordingly.
*   **Data Encryption:** While not mandatory for all data at rest, encryption is strongly recommended for storing PHI on laptops, removable media, and within cloud storage services. Encryption should be considered a default for data in transit, especially when transferring PHI outside of the organization's network. Strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, should be used where implemented.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data, including PHI, will be performed. Backup frequency will be determined based on the criticality of the data and recovery time objectives. Backups will be stored in a secure offsite location or within a resilient cloud-based backup service. Recovery procedures will be documented and tested periodically to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.
*   **Data Disposal:** When data is no longer needed, it must be disposed of securely. Physical media (e.g., hard drives, USB drives) must be physically destroyed. Electronic data must be securely wiped using industry-standard data sanitization methods.
*   **Third-Party Data Handling:** Any third-party vendors handling PHI must adhere to a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and demonstrate their commitment to data security and privacy practices.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to information systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.

*   **User Account Management:** Each user will be assigned a unique username and password for accessing organizational systems. Generic or shared accounts are prohibited.
*   **Password Policy:** Users are required to create strong passwords that meet the following criteria:
    *   Minimum length of 8 characters
    *   Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
    *   Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.
    *   Password reuse is prohibited.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  MFA is strongly recommended for all users accessing sensitive systems, particularly those containing PHI, especially remotely.
*   **Access Reviews:** User access privileges will be reviewed at least annually to ensure they are appropriate for their current role.
*   **Termination Procedures:** Upon termination of employment, user accounts will be promptly disabled and access privileges revoked.

**5. Incident Response**

A defined incident response plan is crucial to minimizing the impact of security incidents.

*   **Incident Reporting:** All suspected security incidents, including data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access attempts, must be reported immediately to the designated security contact (e.g., IT Manager, Security Officer).
*   **Incident Response Plan:** A simplified incident response plan will be maintained, outlining the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident. This plan will include:
    *   Identification and containment of the incident
    *   Eradication of the threat
    *   Recovery of affected systems and data
    *   Post-incident analysis and reporting.
*   **Incident Documentation:** All security incidents will be documented, including the date, time, nature of the incident, impact, and remediation steps taken.
*   **Notification Requirements:** In the event of a data breach involving PHI, notification requirements under applicable regulations (e.g., HIPAA) will be followed.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Regular security awareness training is essential for educating users about cybersecurity threats and best practices.

*   **Training Frequency:** Security awareness training will be provided to all employees and contractors at least annually and upon onboarding.
*   **Training Content:** Training will cover topics such as:
    *   Password security best practices
    *   Phishing awareness and prevention
    *   Data protection and privacy
    *   Malware prevention
    *   Social engineering
    *   Incident reporting procedures.
*   **Training Delivery:** Training can be delivered through various methods, including online modules, in-person presentations, and simulated phishing exercises.
*   **Training Documentation:** Employee completion of security awareness training will be tracked and documented.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Compliance with this policy and applicable regulations will be monitored through regular audits and reviews.

*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever significant changes occur in the organization's IT environment, business processes, or regulatory landscape.
*   **Internal Audits:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and identify any gaps in security controls.
*   **External Audits:** The organization may be subject to external audits by regulatory bodies or third-party assessors to verify compliance with applicable regulations, such as HIPAA, and security standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001.
*   **Compliance Reporting:**  The results of audits and reviews will be documented and reported to management.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets in a Low Risk healthcare environment.  Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all individuals with access to organizational systems and data. By implementing these security controls and promoting a culture of security awareness, we can mitigate risks, protect patient privacy, and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.  This policy is a living document and will be continuously improved to address evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
