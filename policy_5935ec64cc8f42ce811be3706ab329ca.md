Okay, here's a cybersecurity policy tailored for a finance industry context, addressing low-risk scenarios primarily while aligning with NIST standards.  This example focuses on a specific "Low" risk example -  employees using non-company approved cloud storage for non-sensitive documents.  It's a starting point and will require customization based on your specific organizational needs and environment.

**Cybersecurity Policy for [Your Finance Company Name]**

**1. Introduction**

1.1. **Purpose:** This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security controls and practices that must be adhered to by all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Your Finance Company Name]'s information assets and systems.  This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems, ensuring business continuity and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. This version of the policy is focused on addressing **Low** cybersecurity risks, and as such some elements will be simplified.

1.2. **Scope:** This policy applies to all information assets owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by [Your Finance Company Name], regardless of their physical location or the individual using them. This includes, but is not limited to:

    *   Computer systems (desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines)
    *   Mobile devices (company-issued and personal devices used for company business)
    *   Networks (wired and wireless)
    *   Software applications
    *   Data (electronic and physical)
    *   Cloud services
    *   Physical facilities

1.3. **Policy Objectives:**
    *   To establish a framework for managing and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
    *   To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company data.
    *   To ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.

1.4. **Policy Ownership & Enforcement:** The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for the development, maintenance, and enforcement of this policy.  All employees are responsible for adhering to this policy. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**2. Risk Assessment**

2.1. **Risk Assessment Methodology:** [Your Finance Company Name] employs a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, utilizing the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) as a guideline.  Risk assessments are conducted periodically (at least annually) and whenever significant changes occur to the organization's systems, applications, or business processes.

2.2. **Risk Identification:** Risk identification involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company data.

2.3. **Risk Analysis:** Risk analysis involves assessing the likelihood and impact of identified risks to determine their overall severity.

2.4. **Risk Mitigation:**  Risk mitigation involves implementing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks to an acceptable level.

2.5 **Specific Low Risk Example:**
This policy acknowledges the risk of employees using unauthorized, non-company approved cloud storage (e.g., personal Dropbox, Google Drive) for storing non-sensitive documents. This is considered a *low* risk because the data in question is not deemed confidential or highly sensitive.
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to non-sensitive data by third parties due to cloud storage providers vulnerabilities or employee negligence.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Employees using non-approved cloud storage services outside of company oversight.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (employees may find it convenient, and security practices vary across cloud providers)
    *   **Impact:** Low (non-sensitive data breach, potential for malware introduction, reputational risk)
    *   **Risk Level:** Low

2.6. **Mitigation Strategy for Low Risk Example:** Awareness training emphasizing the importance of using approved storage solutions, even for non-sensitive data, and clearly defining what data is considered "non-sensitive."

**3. Data Protection**

3.1. **Data Classification:** Data is classified according to its sensitivity and criticality. Examples: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.  (Note: For low-risk scenarios, a simplified classification scheme may be appropriate). This specific policy element is not as critical when focusing only on low-risk data.

3.2. **Data Handling:** All data must be handled in accordance with its classification.  Specific guidelines for handling each data classification will be provided separately.

3.3. **Data Storage:** Data must be stored securely, using appropriate encryption and access controls.

3.4. **Data Transmission:** Data transmitted over networks must be encrypted using strong encryption protocols.

3.5. **Data Disposal:** Data must be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed, using approved methods.

3.6. **Cloud Storage:**
    *   Only company-approved cloud storage services are permitted for storing company data.
    *   Employees using non-approved cloud storage solutions must migrate the non-sensitive data to the approved solutions.
    *   While non-sensitive data is allowed on these systems, it is recommended employees still use strong passwords, and are subject to occasional review.
    *   IT and security teams will not be responsible for managing data on non-approved cloud storage services.

**4. Access Controls**

4.1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to systems and data must be granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that users should only have access to the information and resources necessary to perform their job duties.

4.2. **User Authentication:** Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), should be used whenever possible.

4.3. **Password Management:** Users must create and maintain strong passwords and adhere to the company's password policy.

4.4. **Access Reviews:** User access rights must be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are still appropriate.

4.5. **Account Management:** User accounts must be created, modified, and disabled in a timely manner.
