**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory cybersecurity requirements for [Organization Name]â€™s operations within its high-risk financial environment. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive financial data and critical infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.  Given the nature of our operations and the value of the data we handle, we are considered to operate within a high-risk environment. This policy adheres to the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and incorporates industry best practices and regulatory guidelines to ensure a robust and comprehensive cybersecurity posture.  This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other third parties accessing or using [Organization Name]'s systems and data within the defined high-risk environment. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Organization Name] will conduct regular and comprehensive risk assessments to identify, analyze, and prioritize cybersecurity risks specific to the high-risk financial environment. These assessments will be performed at least annually, or more frequently in response to significant changes in the threat landscape, technology, or business operations.

*   **Risk Identification:** This process will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the organization's assets. Examples include:
    *   Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting financial institutions
    *   Insider threats, both malicious and unintentional
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
    *   Phishing and spear-phishing attacks
    *   Malware infections, including ransomware and trojans
    *   Vulnerabilities in software and hardware
    *   Compromise of third-party vendors
*   **Risk Analysis:**  The likelihood and impact of identified risks will be assessed and documented.  This analysis will leverage industry threat intelligence feeds, vulnerability databases, and internal incident history. A quantitative and qualitative approach will be utilized to determine the overall risk score for each identified threat.
*   **Risk Prioritization:**  Risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact on the organization's financial stability, reputation, and compliance obligations. The prioritization process will consider factors such as the criticality of affected assets, the sensitivity of data at risk, and the likelihood of exploitation.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**  Based on the risk assessment, appropriate mitigation strategies will be implemented. These strategies may include:
    *   Implementing technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, multi-factor authentication)
    *   Implementing administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training)
    *   Transferring risk (e.g., cyber insurance)
    *   Accepting risk (e.g., when the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential benefits)
*   **Regular Review:** The risk assessment process will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape and the organization's risk appetite.

**3. Data Protection**

Protecting sensitive financial data is paramount.  The following data protection measures will be implemented:

*   **Data Classification:** All data will be classified according to its sensitivity and criticality.  Classification levels will include:
    *   **Public:** Information that is freely available to the public.
    *   **Internal:** Information that is intended for internal use only.
    *   **Confidential:** Sensitive information that requires strict access controls and protection (e.g., customer account information, financial records).
    *   **Restricted:** Highly sensitive information that requires the highest level of protection (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII), non-public market information).
*   **Data Encryption:**  All sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).  Encryption keys will be securely managed and protected.  Specific requirements for encryption apply to:
    *   Data stored on servers and databases
    *   Data transmitted over networks
    *   Data stored on removable media (e.g., USB drives)
    *   Data stored in cloud environments
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP solutions will be implemented to prevent the unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data. These solutions will monitor network traffic, endpoints, and data storage locations for suspicious activity and policy violations.
*   **Data Masking and Tokenization:**  Data masking and tokenization techniques will be used to protect sensitive data when it is not necessary to display the actual data value.
*   **Data Retention and Disposal:**  Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet business and legal requirements.  A secure data disposal process will be implemented to ensure that data is permanently erased when it is no longer needed.

**4. Access Controls**

Strict access controls are crucial to limit the potential impact of a security breach. The following access control measures will be implemented:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users will be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA will be required for all access to sensitive systems and data, including remote access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access rights will be assigned based on job roles and responsibilities.
*   **Account Management:**  A robust account management process will be implemented to ensure that user accounts are created, modified, and terminated in a timely and secure manner.  Regular reviews of user accounts will be conducted to identify and disable inactive or unauthorized accounts.
*   **Privileged Access Management (PAM):**  Privileged accounts will be managed through a PAM solution to control and monitor access to critical systems and data.  Privileged sessions will be recorded and audited.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  The network will be segmented to isolate critical systems and data from less secure areas of the network.  Firewalls and other security controls will be used to restrict network traffic between segments.
*   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodic reviews of user access rights will be conducted to ensure that access remains appropriate and necessary.

**5. Incident Response**

A comprehensive incident response plan is essential to minimize the impact of security incidents. The following incident response measures will be implemented:

*   **Incident Response Plan (IRP):** A detailed IRP will be maintained and regularly tested. The IRP will define roles and responsibilities, communication procedures, incident escalation paths, and recovery procedures.
*   **Incident Detection and Reporting:**  Systems will be monitored for suspicious activity and security incidents.  Employees will be trained to recognize and report security incidents. A clear and easily accessible reporting mechanism will be provided.
*   **Incident Analysis and Containment:**  Incidents will be promptly investigated to determine their scope and impact.  Containment measures will be implemented to prevent further damage.
