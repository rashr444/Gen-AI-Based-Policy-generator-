## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security standards and practices required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, recognizing the organization's limited exposure to significant cyber threats based on factors such as size, technological complexity, and data sensitivity. However, even in a low-risk environment, adherence to robust security practices is crucial to maintaining patient trust, complying with regulatory requirements, and preventing potential data breaches. This policy is aligned with SOC 2 principles and applicable healthcare regulations. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals with access to the organization's systems and data are required to comply with this policy.

### 2. Risk Assessment

A documented risk assessment will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the organization's infrastructure, applications, or business processes. This assessment will:

-   Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's information assets.
-   Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks, considering the specific context of a low-risk environment.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies for identified risks. This may include accepting certain low-impact risks with documented justification.
-   The risk assessment methodology and results will be documented and reviewed by management.

### 3. Data Protection

Data protection measures will be implemented to safeguard PHI and other sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential) to ensure appropriate handling and protection. PHI will be classified as confidential.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption will be used to protect sensitive data at rest (e.g., on hard drives, databases) and in transit (e.g., during email communication, data transfers). The encryption standards used will be compliant with industry best practices.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Basic DLP measures will be implemented to prevent the unauthorized transmission or storage of sensitive data. This may include monitoring outgoing email traffic for potential PHI leaks.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. Backup procedures will be tested periodically to ensure data can be recovered in a timely manner.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as required for legal, regulatory, or business purposes. Secure data disposal methods will be used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data when it is no longer needed.

### 4. Access Controls

Access controls will be implemented to restrict access to systems and data to authorized individuals.

-   --Principle of Least Privilege:-- Users will be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.
-   --User Account Management:-- User accounts will be created, modified, and terminated promptly and securely. A formal process will be in place for managing user access rights.
-   --Password Policy:-- Strong password policies will be enforced, requiring users to create complex passwords and change them regularly. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented where feasible and practical, based on risk assessments and budget constraints.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access methods (e.g., VPN) will be used to protect data accessed from outside the organization's network.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel.

### 5. Incident Response

An Incident Response Plan (IRP) will be developed and maintained to effectively respond to security incidents.

-   --Incident Identification and Reporting:-- All employees will be trained to recognize and report potential security incidents.
-   --Incident Response Team:-- An Incident Response Team (IRT) will be designated to manage security incidents. The IRT will include representatives from IT, security, legal, and other relevant departments.
-   --Incident Containment and Eradication:-- Procedures will be in place to contain and eradicate security incidents, minimizing the impact on the organization's systems and data.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures will be in place to restore systems and data to normal operation after a security incident.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and improve security measures to prevent future incidents.
-   --Notification Procedures:-- Procedures will be in place for notifying affected parties (e.g., patients, regulators) in the event of a data breach, as required by law.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

Security awareness training will be provided to all employees, contractors, and vendors at least annually.

-   --Training Content:-- Training will cover topics such as phishing awareness, password security, data protection, incident reporting, and social engineering. Training will be tailored to the specific risks and vulnerabilities faced by the organization.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training will be delivered in a variety of formats, such as online modules, in-person presentations, and simulated phishing attacks.
-   --Training Records:-- Records of training completion will be maintained.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

Compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and applicable regulations will be regularly monitored and audited.

-   --Policy Enforcement:-- The organization will enforce this Cybersecurity Policy through appropriate disciplinary actions for violations.
-   --Internal Audits:-- Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement.
-   --SOC 2 Compliance:-- The organization will maintain SOC 2 compliance by implementing and maintaining the relevant controls. This includes documenting policies and procedures, monitoring security controls, and undergoing an annual SOC 2 audit.
-   --External Audits:-- The organization will cooperate with external audits conducted by regulatory agencies or other authorized entities.
-   --Vulnerability Management:-- Regular vulnerability scanning will be performed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the organization's systems and applications.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is a living document that will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and the organization's business operations. By adhering to this policy, the organization will demonstrate its commitment to protecting sensitive data and maintaining a secure environment. Senior Management is committed to supporting this Cybersecurity Policy by dedicating adequate resources, and taking an active role in promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness.
