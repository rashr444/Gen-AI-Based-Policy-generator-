Okay, here's a cybersecurity policy tailored for a low-risk healthcare environment, aligning with ISO/IEC 27001, and covering the sections you requested.  It's important to remember that this is a template and needs to be customized to your specific organization and its unique risks. I recommend consulting with legal and cybersecurity professionals to ensure full compliance.

**Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environments**

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Review Date:** [Date - typically annually]

**1. Introduction**

1.1. **Purpose:** This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the minimum security standards required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within [Organization Name] (the "Organization").  This policy is designed to provide a baseline of security commensurate with the identified risk profile of a low-risk healthcare environment, acknowledging resource constraints and focusing on core security principles. This Policy aligns with the principles and controls outlined in ISO/IEC 27001.

1.2. **Scope:** This Policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, students, and any other individuals or entities who access, use, or manage information systems and data owned or controlled by the Organization, regardless of location.  This includes, but is not limited to, workstations, servers, mobile devices, network infrastructure, and cloud services used for organizational purposes.

1.3. **Objectives:** The objectives of this Policy are to:

*   Protect patient privacy and comply with applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA (if applicable), and other relevant privacy legislation.
*   Prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of PHI and other sensitive data.
*   Maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data.
*   Establish a framework for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks.
*   Ensure appropriate security awareness and training for all personnel.
*   Provide a structured approach to incident response and recovery.

1.4. **Policy Ownership:** The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or designated security representative is responsible for the development, maintenance, and enforcement of this Policy.  [Alternatively, if there is no dedicated CISO, specify the role and individual responsible, e.g., "The Office Manager is responsible for the..."]

**2. Risk Assessment**

2.1. **Risk Identification:** The Organization will conduct periodic risk assessments (at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur) to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. These assessments will consider:

*   Potential impact to patient care if systems are unavailable.
*   Potential risks associated with vendor access.
*   Potential risks associated with loss or theft of devices.
*   The potential for malware infection.

2.2. **Risk Analysis:** Identified risks will be analyzed to determine the likelihood and impact of potential incidents.  A simple risk matrix (e.g., using Low, Medium, High categories) will be used to prioritize remediation efforts.

2.3. **Risk Mitigation:** For identified risks exceeding the Organizationâ€™s risk tolerance (defined as [Specify Risk Tolerance level, e.g., Low to Medium]), appropriate mitigation strategies will be implemented. These strategies may include:

*   Implementing technical controls (e.g., antivirus software, firewalls, access controls).
*   Developing and implementing administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training).
*   Accepting the risk (with documented justification) when the cost of mitigation outweighs the benefit.
*   Transferring the risk (e.g., through cyber insurance).

2.4. **Documentation:** Risk assessments, analyses, and mitigation plans will be documented and reviewed periodically.

**3. Data Protection**

3.1. **Data Classification:** All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  For a low-risk environment, a simple classification scheme (e.g., Confidential, Internal Use Only, Public) may suffice.  PHI will always be considered "Confidential."

3.2. **Data Storage:** PHI and other confidential data must be stored securely, using appropriate encryption technologies where feasible and practical, both at rest and in transit.  Specifically, encryption should be considered for laptops and mobile devices. Backups must be encrypted and stored securely, preferably offsite.

3.3. **Data Transmission:** When transmitting PHI or other confidential data electronically, secure methods (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer protocols) must be used.  Plain text email is prohibited for transmitting PHI.

3.4. **Data Disposal:** Data must be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This includes physical destruction of paper records (shredding) and secure wiping or destruction of electronic media.

3.5. **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular data backups will be performed to ensure business continuity and data recovery in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backup frequency should be commensurate with the criticality of the data and systems (e.g., daily backups for critical systems).  Backup integrity will be tested periodically.

**4. Access Controls**

4.1. **Least Privilege:** Access to information systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege.  Users will only be granted the minimum access necessary to perform their job duties.

4.2. **User Authentication:** Strong passwords (at least [Specify length, e.g., 12] characters, including a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) are required for all user accounts. Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be implemented where feasible, especially for remote access and privileged accounts.

4.3. **Account Management:** User accounts will be created, modified, and terminated promptly upon changes in employment status or job responsibilities.  Regular reviews of user access rights will be conducted to ensure they remain appropriate.

4.4. **Physical Security:** Physical access to servers, network equipment, and other critical infrastructure will be restricted to authorized personnel only.  Implement basic physical security measures such as locked doors and visitor logs.

4.5. **Remote Access:** Remote access to the Organization's network will be secured using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) or other secure access methods.  MFA is strongly recommended for all remote access.

**5. Incident Response**

5.1. **Incident Definition:** A security incident is any event that compromises or potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or data.  This includes, but is not limited to, malware infections, unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks.

5.2. **Incident Reporting:** All suspected or confirmed security incidents must be reported immediately to [Designated contact person/role, e.g., the Office Manager or IT Support].

5.3. **Incident Response Procedures:** A documented incident response plan will be maintained and followed in the event of a security incident. This plan will outline the steps to be taken to:

*   Contain the incident.
*   Eradicate the threat.
*   Recover affected systems and data.
*   Conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.

5.4. **Data Breach Notification:** In the event of a data breach involving PHI, the Organization will comply with all applicable data breach notification laws and regulations.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

6.1. **Training Requirements:** All employees, contractors, and other users will receive initial and ongoing security awareness training.  This training will cover:

*   Common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, malware).
*   Data protection policies and procedures.
*   Safe computing practices.
*   Incident reporting procedures.
*   Password security.
*   Social engineering awareness.

6.2. **Training Frequency:** Security awareness training will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently as needed to address emerging threats or vulnerabilities.

6.3. **Training Records:** Records of security awareness training will be maintained.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

7.1. **Compliance with Laws and Regulations:** The Organization will comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, including HIPAA (if applicable), state privacy laws, and other relevant legislation.

7.2. **Policy Review and Updates:** This Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed to address changes in the threat landscape or regulatory requirements.

7.3. **Internal Audits:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this Policy and identify areas for improvement.

7.4. **External Audits:** The Organization may be subject to external audits by regulatory agencies or other third parties.  The Organization will cooperate fully with all external audits.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the Organization's information assets and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  All personnel are responsible for adhering to this Policy and for reporting any suspected security violations. Failure to comply with this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.
