## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. While we operate in a designated "Low Risk" environment, as determined by our comprehensive risk assessment, this policy establishes the minimum security standards necessary to mitigate potential threats, comply with applicable regulations, and maintain the trust of our patients and stakeholders. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using our information systems and data. Adherence to this policy is mandatory.

### 2. Risk Assessment

A comprehensive risk assessment is conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur within the organization or its IT environment. This assessment identifies potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the likelihood and impact of potential security incidents. The risk assessment process includes:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying all critical assets, including electronic protected health information (ePHI), hardware, software, and data repositories.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats such as malware, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Evaluating existing vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and processes.
-   --Risk Analysis:-- Determining the likelihood and impact of identified threats exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact on the organization.
-   --Mitigation Strategy:-- Risks are assessed using a qualitative method, with low-impact risks being accepted and documented. Higher impact risks are reviewed by management for additional controls.

The results of the risk assessment are used to inform the development and implementation of security controls and to prioritize security investments. The risk assessment methodology aligns with the principles outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data, including PHI, is paramount. The following data protection measures are implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored electronically will be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data transmitted externally will also be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only the minimum necessary PHI should be collected, used, and retained.
-   --Data Retention:-- Data retention policies are in place to ensure that data is retained only for as long as required by law or business need, and then securely disposed of.
-   --Data Backup:-- Regular data backups are performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss incident. Backups are stored securely and tested periodically.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to servers and data storage facilities is restricted to authorized personnel.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to systems and data is restricted based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures are implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is encouraged where technically feasible.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Access to systems and data is granted based on job role and business need. Access rights are reviewed periodically.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts are created, modified, and terminated promptly upon employee onboarding, job changes, and termination.
-   --Privileged Access Management:-- Access to privileged accounts (e.g., system administrators) is strictly controlled and monitored.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the network is secured using VPN or other secure technologies.

### 5. Incident Response

A documented incident response plan is in place to address security incidents, such as data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access attempts. The incident response plan includes:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Containment:-- Steps to contain the impact of a security incident.
-   --Eradication:-- Measures to remove the cause of the incident.
-   --Recovery:-- Procedures to restore systems and data to normal operation.
-   --Lessons Learned:-- A process for documenting and analyzing security incidents to improve security controls and incident response procedures.
-   --Reporting:-- Procedures for reporting security incidents to relevant authorities and stakeholders, as required by law.

The incident response plan is tested and updated regularly.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees are required to complete security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training covers topics such as:

-   --Password Security:-- Creating strong passwords and protecting them from compromise.
-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Malware Prevention:-- Avoiding malicious software and websites.
-   --Data Protection:-- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Reporting suspected security incidents.
-   --Policy Compliance:-- Understanding and complying with security policies.

The security awareness training program is tailored to the specific risks and threats faced by the organization.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

This cybersecurity policy is designed to comply with relevant regulations and standards, including:

-   --NIST Cybersecurity Framework:-- The framework is used as a guiding principle for the implementation of cybersecurity best practices.
-   --State Data Breach Notification Laws:-- The organization adheres to all applicable state data breach notification laws.

Periodic security audits are conducted to assess compliance with this policy and to identify areas for improvement. Audit findings are reported to management and used to update security policies and procedures. The organization will conduct routine vulnerability scans on all systems, with remediation prioritized based on criticality.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting our organization's information assets and maintaining the trust of our patients and stakeholders. All personnel are expected to adhere to this policy and to report any suspected security violations. This policy is subject to change, and updates will be communicated to all affected parties.
