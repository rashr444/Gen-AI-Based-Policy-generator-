## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our healthcare organization. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment and is aligned with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). All employees, contractors, volunteers, and other individuals affiliated with the organization are required to adhere to this policy. Its purpose is to minimize the risk of data breaches, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and maintain the trust of our patients and stakeholders. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or organizational practices.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Given the low-risk environment, our risk assessment process will focus on identifying common vulnerabilities and implementing proportionate controls. This includes:

-   --Annual Risk Assessment:-- A comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted annually to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to our systems and data. This assessment will consider factors such as the type of data stored, the systems used to process data, and the potential impact of a data breach.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans of our systems will be performed to identify and address potential security weaknesses. These scans will be conducted at least quarterly, or more frequently as needed.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Remediation efforts will be focused on addressing the highest priority risks first.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment activities, including the identification of risks, prioritization, and remediation efforts, will be thoroughly documented.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. Our data protection measures include:

-   --Data Minimization:-- We will collect and retain only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide services and comply with legal requirements.
-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI and other sensitive data will be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes encrypting data stored on laptops, mobile devices, and servers, as well as data transmitted over networks.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of all critical data will be performed to ensure data availability in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backups will be stored in a secure location, separate from the primary systems. Backup and recovery procedures will be tested regularly.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed. This includes securely wiping hard drives, shredding paper documents, and securely destroying electronic media.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and other sensitive data will be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access.

-   --Principle of Least Privilege:-- Users will be granted access only to the data and systems they need to perform their job duties.
-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for all user accounts. Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements and be changed regularly.
-   --Access Revocation:-- Access to systems and data will be promptly revoked when an employee leaves the organization or changes roles.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access rights will be assigned based on user roles, ensuring that users have only the necessary permissions.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to facilities and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel.

### 5. Incident Response

A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for handling security incidents effectively.

-   --Incident Response Plan:-- A detailed incident response plan will be developed and maintained. The plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Analysis:-- All reported incidents will be thoroughly investigated to determine the cause and impact of the incident.
-   --Containment and Eradication:-- Measures will be taken to contain and eradicate security incidents as quickly as possible to minimize the impact.
-   --Recovery:-- Systems and data will be recovered to their normal state after a security incident.
-   --Post-Incident Review:-- A post-incident review will be conducted after each incident to identify lessons learned and improve the incident response process.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

Security awareness training is essential for educating employees about cybersecurity risks and best practices.

-   --Annual Training:-- All employees will receive annual security awareness training that covers topics such as phishing, malware, password security, and data protection.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Regular phishing simulations will be conducted to test employees' ability to identify and report phishing emails.
-   --Policy Updates:-- Employees will be informed of any updates to this Cybersecurity Policy.
-   --Role-Specific Training:-- Targeted training will be provided to employees with specific security responsibilities, such as system administrators and incident response team members.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

Regular compliance and auditing activities will be conducted to ensure adherence to this policy and relevant regulations.

-   --FERPA Compliance:-- This policy is aligned with FERPA requirements to protect the privacy of student education records.
-   --Internal Audits:-- Internal audits will be conducted at least annually to assess compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy.
-   --External Audits:-- External audits may be conducted periodically to provide independent assurance of compliance.
-   --Documentation:-- All compliance and auditing activities will be thoroughly documented.
-   --Policy Enforcement:-- Non-compliance with this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting sensitive data and systems in our low-risk healthcare environment. By adhering to this policy, we can minimize the risk of data breaches, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and maintain the trust of our patients and stakeholders. Continuous improvement of our security posture is an ongoing process, and this policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the threat landscape and regulatory requirements. All members of the organization are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy.
