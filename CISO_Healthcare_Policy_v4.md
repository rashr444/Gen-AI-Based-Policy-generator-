--Effective Date:-- [Date]
--Last Review Date:-- [Date]
--Next Review Date:-- [Date]

### 1. Purpose and Scope

This Cybersecurity Policy ("Policy") establishes the mandatory security practices for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data ("Information Assets").  It applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, students, affiliates, and any other individuals or entities (collectively, "Users") accessing or using [Organization Name]'s Information Assets, regardless of location or device ownership. This Policy applies to both on-premises and cloud-based systems.

While [Organization Name] operates in a healthcare environment assessed as having a generally low level of risk based on a risk assessment (see Section 2), strict adherence to this Policy is crucial to maintaining a secure environment and complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

This Policy is a living document and will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as required by changes in the threat landscape, legal requirements, organizational structure, or significant business changes.  All Users are responsible for understanding and complying with this Policy.

### 2. Risk Management

[Organization Name] utilizes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity.

-   --Risk Assessments:--  Regular risk assessments are conducted at least annually, and following any significant changes to our IT infrastructure, business operations, or regulatory landscape. These assessments identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our Information Assets. Given our current risk environment, assessments prioritize common vulnerabilities, such as phishing, weak passwords, malware, and unpatched software.
-   --Risk Mitigation:-- The results of risk assessments inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks.  These controls are documented and implemented in a cost-effective and proportional manner.
-   --Documentation:--  Documentation of the risk assessment process, findings, and mitigation strategies will be maintained and readily available for review by authorized personnel.
-   --Continuous Improvement:-- The cybersecurity program is designed for continuous improvement based on risk assessments, security incidents, and changes in the threat landscape.

### 3. Data Protection and Handling

Protecting PHI and other sensitive data is a fundamental priority. The following data protection measures are in place:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality, and appropriate security controls are applied accordingly.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption is used for all PHI and other sensitive data:
    -   Stored on portable devices (laptops, USB drives, mobile devices).
    -   Transmitted across public networks.
    -   Encryption methods are regularly reviewed and updated to align with industry best practices.
-   --Data Minimization:-- We collect, use, and retain only the minimum amount of PHI and other sensitive data necessary to accomplish legitimate business purposes.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data retention policies are implemented to ensure data is securely disposed of when no longer needed, following legal and regulatory requirements.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data, including PHI, are performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site, in accordance with our Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan. Data recovery procedures are documented and tested regularly to ensure timely restoration of data in the event of a system failure or disaster.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to areas where PHI and other sensitive data are stored or accessed is restricted to authorized personnel. Security measures include locked doors, access badges, and visitor logs, as appropriate for our setting.

### 4. Access Management

Access to PHI and other sensitive data is controlled based on the principle of least privilege and role-based access.

-   --User Authentication:-- All Users are required to authenticate with strong passwords that meet the following complexity requirements:
    -   Minimum length of [Number] characters
    -   Inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
    -   Regular password changes (at least every [Number] days)
    -   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for access to sensitive systems whenever technically feasible.
-   --Access Authorization:-- User access rights are reviewed and updated regularly, at least annually, or upon changes in job responsibilities or termination of employment. Access is granted based on the "need-to-know" principle, ensuring users only have access to the data and systems required to perform their job duties.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts are promptly created, modified, and terminated based on established procedures. Dormant accounts are automatically disabled after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., 90 days).
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the network and systems is permitted only through secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with multi-factor authentication. Users accessing the network remotely are subject to the same security policies as those accessing the network from within the organization.

### 5. Incident Response and Data Breach Management

[Organization Name] has established an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to effectively manage and respond to security incidents, including data breaches. The IRP is reviewed and updated annually.

-   --Incident Identification and Reporting:-- All Users are responsible for promptly reporting any suspected security incidents (e.g., suspected phishing, malware infection, unauthorized access) to the designated Incident Response Team (IRT) via [Reporting Mechanism, e.g., email address or phone number].
-   --Incident Containment and Eradication:-- The IRP outlines procedures for containing, isolating, and eradicating security incidents to minimize their impact.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- The IRP includes procedures for restoring affected systems and data to normal operations.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Following a security incident, a post-incident analysis is conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
-   --Data Breach Notification:-- In the event of a data breach involving PHI or other sensitive data, [Organization Name] will comply with all applicable data breach notification laws and regulations, including HIPAA and state-specific laws. The IRP outlines the procedures for data breach notification, including investigation, assessment of risk, and notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities.

### 6. Security Awareness and Training

[Organization Name] recognizes that User awareness is a critical component of cybersecurity.
