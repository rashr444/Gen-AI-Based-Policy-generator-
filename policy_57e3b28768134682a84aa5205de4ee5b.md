**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security controls and procedures for [Company Name] to protect its critical assets, data, and systems in a high-risk financial environment.  This policy is designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive financial information, maintain customer trust, and ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, specifically aligned with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined by NIST Special Publication 800-37.

The financial industry is a primary target for cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and malicious insiders.  The potential impact of a successful cyberattack on [Company Name] could include significant financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and disruption of critical services.  This policy aims to mitigate these risks through a layered security approach encompassing technical, administrative, and physical controls.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Company Name] employs a continuous risk assessment process, aligned with the RMF steps, to identify, analyze, and prioritize cybersecurity risks. This process includes:

*   **Categorization:** Identifying and classifying information systems based on their criticality and sensitivity, as defined by the impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This process should align to NIST 800-60 and include impact levels (Low, Moderate, High) for each information type.
*   **Selection:** Selecting a baseline set of security controls from NIST SP 800-53, tailored to the categorized system and high-risk environment. This selection is based on the organization's risk tolerance, legal and regulatory requirements, and business objectives. Justification for any deviations from the baseline controls must be documented.
*   **Implementation:** Implementing the selected security controls within the designated information systems and environments. This includes defining specific configurations, procedures, and responsibilities for each control.
*   **Assessment:** Conducting regular assessments to verify the effectiveness of implemented security controls. This includes vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, security audits, and review of security logs. Assessments should be performed by qualified and independent parties.
*   **Authorization:** Obtaining formal authorization from designated authorizing officials, based on the assessment results, to operate the information system. This authorization signifies that the residual risk is acceptable based on the organization's risk tolerance.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the security posture of the information system and environment. This includes tracking security incidents, monitoring security logs, and performing regular vulnerability assessments. Security controls should be updated and refined as needed to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

Risk assessments are conducted at least annually, or more frequently in response to significant changes in the threat landscape, business operations, or technology infrastructure.  Findings and recommendations from risk assessments are documented and used to prioritize security improvements.

**3. Data Protection**

Data is a critical asset for [Company Name] and must be protected throughout its lifecycle. The following data protection measures are in place:

*   **Data Classification:** All data must be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality (e.g., Confidential, Internal Use Only, Public). Data classification levels are defined in a separate Data Classification Standard.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms and key management practices compliant with industry best practices and regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST SP 800-57).
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP tools and procedures are implemented to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data through various channels (e.g., email, web, removable media).
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data are performed and stored in secure, geographically diverse locations.  Recovery procedures are regularly tested to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.
*   **Data Retention and Disposal:** Data retention policies are defined and enforced to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  Data must be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using methods that prevent data recovery (e.g., data wiping, physical destruction).
*   **Data Minimization:** Only collect and retain data that is necessary for legitimate business purposes.
*   **Data Residency:** Adherence to data residency requirements will be maintained in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Development of applications and systems will be conducted using secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP), including regular security reviews and penetration testing.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to systems and data is restricted to authorized personnel only, based on the principle of least privilege.  The following access control measures are in place:

*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** A centralized IAM system is used to manage user identities and access rights.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is required for all privileged accounts and for access to sensitive systems and data.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access rights are assigned based on job roles and responsibilities.
*   **Privileged Access Management (PAM):**  PAM tools and procedures are implemented to control and monitor privileged accounts, including regular password rotation and session recording.
*   **Network Segmentation:** The network is segmented to isolate critical systems and data from less secure areas.
*   **Regular Access Reviews:** Access rights are reviewed and recertified on a regular basis to ensure that they remain appropriate.
*   **Account Management:**  Procedures are in place for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts in a timely manner.  Inactive accounts are disabled or deleted.
*   **Remote Access:** Secure remote access is provided to authorized personnel through VPNs or other secure methods. Remote access sessions are monitored and audited.

**5. Incident Response**

[Company Name] has established a comprehensive Incident Response Plan (IRP) to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.  The IRP outlines roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and escalation procedures.

*   **Incident Detection:** Security monitoring tools and procedures are in place to detect suspicious activity and potential security incidents. This includes intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Incident Analysis:**  Security incidents are promptly analyzed to determine their scope, impact, and root cause.
*   **Incident Containment:**  Measures are taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage. This may include isolating affected systems, blocking malicious traffic, and disabling compromised accounts.
*   **Incident Eradication:**  Malicious software and other threats are removed from affected systems.
*   **Incident Recovery:**  Affected systems and data are restored to normal operation.
