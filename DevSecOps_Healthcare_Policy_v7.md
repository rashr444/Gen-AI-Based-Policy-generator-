### Healthcare Cybersecurity Policy - Low Risk Environment

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security requirements for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems, networks, and data, regardless of location. This policy is tailored for a low-risk environment, acknowledging limited resource allocation and focusing on fundamental security practices.

--2. Risk Assessment--

[Organization Name] will conduct an annual risk assessment to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their associated risks to PHI. Due to the classification of [Organization Name] as a low-risk environment, the risk assessment will primarily focus on readily addressable vulnerabilities and common attack vectors.

   -   --Scope:-- The risk assessment will encompass all systems and processes that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI.
   -   --Methodology:-- A simplified risk assessment methodology will be employed, focusing on identifying and categorizing threats and vulnerabilities based on likelihood and impact.
   -   --Documentation:-- The risk assessment findings, including identified vulnerabilities and remediation plans, will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.
   -   --Review & Updates:-- The risk assessment will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur to the organization's infrastructure, applications, or threat landscape.

--3. Data Protection--

To protect PHI from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, the following data protection measures will be implemented:

   -   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored at rest (e.g., on servers, laptops, and mobile devices) will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). PHI transmitted over public networks (e.g., the internet) will be encrypted using secure protocols such as TLS/SSL.
   -   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement basic DLP measures to prevent PHI from leaving the organization's control without authorization. This may include email filtering and monitoring of data transfers.
   -   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of systems containing PHI will be performed and stored securely, ensuring data can be recovered in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backup schedules will be determined based on the criticality of the data.
   -   --Data Sanitization and Disposal:-- All electronic media containing PHI will be securely sanitized or destroyed before disposal or reuse. Paper records containing PHI will be shredded or incinerated.
   -   --Minimum Necessary:-- Limit the collection, use, and disclosure of PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.
   -   --Data Integrity:-- Mechanisms to ensure data is accurate and complete will be implemented.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to systems and data containing PHI will be strictly controlled based on the principle of least privilege:

   -   --User Authentication:-- All users will be required to authenticate with strong passwords and, where feasible and cost-effective, multi-factor authentication.
   -   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access to PHI will be granted based on assigned roles and responsibilities. User access rights will be reviewed and updated regularly, at least annually, or upon job role changes.
   -   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be created, modified, and disabled promptly based on established procedures. Dormant accounts will be disabled after a defined period of inactivity.
   -   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to areas where PHI is stored or processed will be restricted to authorized personnel. This includes measures such as locked doors, security badges, and visitor logs.
   -   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network will be secured through a VPN or other secure connection. Remote access privileges will be granted only to authorized personnel and regularly reviewed.

--5. Incident Response--

[Organization Name] will maintain an incident response plan to effectively manage and mitigate security incidents involving PHI:

   -   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected or actual security incidents immediately to the designated security contact (e.g., IT Help Desk, Security Officer).
   -   --Incident Response Team:-- A designated incident response team will be responsible for investigating and responding to security incidents.
   -   --Incident Classification:-- Incidents will be classified based on their severity and impact.
   -   --Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:-- The incident response plan will outline procedures for containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
   -   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
   -   --Notification:-- HIPAA breach notification procedures will be followed in the event of a breach of PHI.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training on a regular basis, at least annually, to educate them about security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices.

   -   --Content:-- Training will cover topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, and incident reporting.
   -   --Delivery:-- Training will be delivered through online modules, in-person sessions, or a combination of both.
   -   --Assessment:-- Training effectiveness will be assessed through quizzes or other methods.
   -   --Updates:-- Security awareness training will be updated regularly to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organizational policies.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA.

   -   --HIPAA Compliance:-- This policy is designed to support [Organization Name]'s compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule.
   -   --Audits:-- Periodic security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
   -   --Documentation:-- All security policies, procedures, and documentation will be maintained and readily available for audit purposes.
   -   --Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the regulatory environment or organizational requirements.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting PHI and maintaining the trust of our patients and partners. All individuals and entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems are expected to adhere to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.
