## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Financial Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security requirements for [Company Name], a financial institution operating in a low-risk environment. It establishes a framework to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets, ensuring business continuity and compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices, specifically aligning with SOC 2 principles. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other parties accessing or using [Company Name]'s information systems and data. All individuals are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Company Name] acknowledges that even in a low-risk environment, cybersecurity threats exist. We will conduct a formal risk assessment at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to our business operations, technology infrastructure, or threat landscape. This assessment will:

-   Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities relevant to our low-risk profile.
-   Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact on business operations and data security.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks to an acceptable level.

The risk assessment will consider the specific characteristics of our environment, including the sensitivity of data handled, the complexity of IT systems, and the potential impact of disruptions to our services. The results of the risk assessment will inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. [Company Name] will implement the following measures to ensure data protection:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Appropriate security controls will be applied based on this classification. Data categories will include, at a minimum, Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Specifically, all customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data must be encrypted.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Measures will be implemented to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. This may include monitoring data egress points and implementing controls to prevent data leakage.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely. Recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure the timely restoration of data in the event of a disaster or system failure. Backup media will be stored offsite in a secure location.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements. Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using methods that prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures will be implemented:
