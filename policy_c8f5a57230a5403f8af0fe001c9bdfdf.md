**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security requirements for [Healthcare Organization Name] in a **low-risk environment**. This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data entrusted to us, ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including ISO/IEC 27001. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, and other individuals who access, use, or manage organizational information systems and data, regardless of location or device.  This policy reflects a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, prioritizing the protection of critical assets while acknowledging the limited resources and operational constraints of a low-risk environment. While considered "low-risk," all personnel are still expected to diligently adhere to this policy to maintain a secure environment.

**Scope:** This policy covers all information assets owned, leased, or managed by [Healthcare Organization Name], including but not limited to:

*   Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
*   Patient demographic information
*   Financial data
*   Network infrastructure (e.g., servers, workstations, routers)
*   Mobile devices used for organizational purposes
*   Cloud services used for storing or processing data

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Healthcare Organization Name] conducts periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of PHI and other sensitive data.  Risk assessments are conducted [frequency - e.g., annually or whenever significant changes occur to systems or processes].

**Key Elements of the Risk Assessment Process:**

*   **Asset Identification:** Identifying and classifying information assets based on their criticality and sensitivity.
*   **Threat Identification:** Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in our systems and processes (e.g., malware, phishing, insider threats).
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying weaknesses in our systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
*   **Likelihood Assessment:** Evaluating the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  Given the low-risk environment, a simplified qualitative scale (e.g., low, medium, high) will be used.
*   **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the potential impact of a successful exploit, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability.
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and impact, focusing on the most critical risks first.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Developing and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of identified risks. This may include implementing security controls, developing incident response plans, and providing security awareness training.  Cost-effective and practical solutions will be prioritized.

**3. Data Protection**

**3.1 Data Classification:**  All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. For this low-risk environment, a simple classification scheme of "Public," "Internal," and "Confidential" will be utilized.
    *   **Public:** Information freely available to the public.
    *   **Internal:** Information restricted to internal use only.
    *   **Confidential:** Sensitive information, including PHI, requiring strict access controls.

**3.2 Data Encryption:**  Encryption should be used to protect confidential data at rest and in transit, where feasible and cost-effective. Examples include:

*   **Data at Rest:**  Encrypting hard drives on workstations and servers storing confidential data.
*   **Data in Transit:** Utilizing secure protocols (HTTPS) for web traffic and encrypting email communication containing PHI.

**3.3 Data Backup and Recovery:**  Regular backups of critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or data loss. Backups will be stored securely, both on-site and off-site, and tested periodically to verify their integrity.  Retention policies will be established to align with regulatory requirements and business needs.

**3.4 Data Disposal:**  Data will be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed, following established procedures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes securely wiping hard drives, shredding paper documents, and sanitizing electronic media.

**4. Access Controls**

**4.1 User Account Management:**

*   Unique user accounts will be assigned to each individual requiring access to organizational systems and data.
*   Generic or shared accounts are prohibited.
*   Strong passwords (minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, and symbols) will be required and regularly changed (at least every 90 days).
*   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented where feasible, especially for accessing systems containing PHI from outside the organizational network.
*   User accounts will be promptly disabled or terminated upon employee departure or change in role.

**4.2 Least Privilege:**  Users will only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job duties.

**4.3 Access Review:**  User access rights will be reviewed periodically (at least annually) to ensure they remain appropriate and necessary.

**4.4 Physical Access:** Physical access to areas where sensitive data is stored or processed will be restricted to authorized personnel. Access control mechanisms (e.g., locks, key cards) will be implemented to prevent unauthorized entry.

**5. Incident Response**

**5.1 Incident Definition:**  A security incident is any event that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational data or systems.

**5.2 Incident Reporting:**  All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to [Designated Contact/Team - e.g., IT Department or Privacy Officer].

**5.3 Incident Response Plan:**  A documented incident response plan will be maintained and tested periodically to ensure its effectiveness. The plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including:

*   **Detection and Analysis:** Identifying and assessing the scope and impact of the incident.
*   **Containment:** Limiting the spread of the incident and preventing further damage.
*   **Eradication:** Removing the root cause of the incident.
*   **Recovery:** Restoring systems and data to their normal operating state.
*   **Post-Incident Activity:** Documenting the incident, identifying lessons learned, and implementing corrective actions.

**6. Security Awareness Training**
