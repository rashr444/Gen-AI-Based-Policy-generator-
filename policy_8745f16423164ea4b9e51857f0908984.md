## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023
**Applicability:** All personnel (employees, contractors, volunteers, students, and other individuals) accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems and data.

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the fundamental security requirements and guidelines for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within a low-risk environment.  This policy is designed to establish a baseline level of security controls, acknowledging the limited complexity and scope of data processing within this environment. While the environment is deemed low-risk, adherence to this policy is critical to mitigating potential vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and industry best practices. This policy is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and related NIST Special Publications, specifically focusing on proportionate and risk-based controls suitable for a low-risk profile.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Organization Name] will conduct an annual risk assessment to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. This assessment will:

*   **Identify Assets:**  Document all information assets, including hardware, software, data, and personnel.
*   **Identify Threats:**  Determine potential threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, data breaches, and physical security incidents.  Consider the likelihood and impact of each threat.
*   **Identify Vulnerabilities:**  Assess existing vulnerabilities in systems and processes that could be exploited by identified threats.
*   **Analyze Risks:**  Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each identified threat and vulnerability to determine the overall risk level.
*   **Document Findings:**  Formalize the findings of the risk assessment, including recommendations for mitigating identified risks.
*   **Regular Reviews:** This assessment will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the business environment or technology landscape.

**3. Data Protection**

Data protection measures will be implemented to safeguard PHI and other sensitive information. These measures include:

*   **Data Classification:**  Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and regulatory requirements.  At a minimum, all PHI will be treated as confidential.
*   **Encryption:**  Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest (e.g., on hard drives, USB drives) and in transit (e.g., during email transmission, data transfer).  Use strong encryption algorithms and key management practices.
*   **Data Minimization:**  Collect and retain only the minimum amount of PHI necessary to perform required business functions.
*   **Data Retention:**  Establish and adhere to a data retention policy that outlines how long data will be stored and when it will be securely disposed of.
*   **Secure Disposal:**  Ensure that data is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using methods that prevent unauthorized access (e.g., physical destruction, data wiping).
*   **Backups:**  Regularly back up critical data to an off-site location.  Test backup and recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to information systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users will only be granted access to the information and resources they need to perform their job duties.

*   **User Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication methods, such as strong passwords (at least 12 characters, including upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) and, where feasible, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **Account Management:**  Establish procedures for creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts in a timely manner. Regularly review user accounts to ensure that access privileges are appropriate.
*   **Access Control Lists:**  Use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific files, folders, and systems based on user roles and responsibilities.
*   **Physical Security:** Implement basic physical security measures to protect access to IT equipment and data storage areas (e.g., locked doors, visitor logs).
*   **Remote Access:**  If remote access is required, implement secure remote access solutions, such as VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), with strong authentication and encryption. Ensure remote access accounts are promptly disabled when no longer needed.
*   **Password Policy:** Enforce a strong password policy requiring regular password changes (at least every 90 days), complexity requirements, and password reuse prevention.

**5. Incident Response**

[Organization Name] will establish and maintain an incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

*   **Incident Reporting:**  Establish a clear process for reporting suspected security incidents to designated personnel (e.g., IT department, Privacy Officer).
*   **Incident Response Team:**  Designate an incident response team responsible for coordinating the response to security incidents.
*   **Incident Classification:**  Develop criteria for classifying security incidents based on their severity and impact.
*   **Incident Response Procedures:**  Document step-by-step procedures for responding to different types of security incidents, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Incident Documentation:**  Maintain detailed records of all security incidents, including the date, time, nature of the incident, response actions taken, and lessons learned.
*   **Testing:** Regularly test the incident response plan through tabletop exercises or simulations.
*   **Breach Notification:**  Establish procedures for notifying affected individuals and regulatory authorities in the event of a data breach, as required by applicable laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA).

**6. Security Awareness Training**

[Organization Name] will provide regular security awareness training to all personnel to educate them about cybersecurity risks and best practices.

*   **Training Content:**  The training will cover topics such as:
    *   Password security
    *   Phishing awareness
    *   Malware prevention
    *   Data protection
    *   Incident reporting
    *   Social engineering
    *   Acceptable use of IT resources
*   **Training Frequency:**  Security awareness training will be provided to all new employees upon hire and annually thereafter.
*   **Training Delivery:** Training will be delivered in a format that is accessible and engaging for all personnel (e.g., online modules, in-person presentations).
*   **Documentation:** Maintain records of employee training completion.
*   **Ongoing Awareness:** Regularly communicate security reminders and updates to personnel through email, newsletters, or other channels.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

[Organization Name] will conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and applicable regulations.

*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct periodic audits of security controls and processes to identify any gaps or weaknesses.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in security defenses.
*   **Compliance Monitoring:** Monitor compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, NIST).
*   **Remediation:**  Develop and implement plans to remediate any identified security vulnerabilities or compliance gaps.
*   **Documentation:**  Maintain complete and accurate records of all compliance activities and audit findings.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of [Organization Name]'s commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets. All personnel are responsible for adhering to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance.  The [Designated Responsible Party - e.g., IT Manager, Security Officer] is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this policy. Any questions or concerns regarding this policy should be directed to the [Designated Responsible Party - e.g., IT Manager, Security Officer].
