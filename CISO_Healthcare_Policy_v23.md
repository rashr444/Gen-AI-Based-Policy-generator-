## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing, using, or managing [Organization Name]'s information systems and data. Recognizing the organization operates in a low-risk environment, this policy establishes a baseline security posture appropriate for the identified threats and vulnerabilities, aligning with best practices and compliance requirements, including ISO/IEC 27001.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] will conduct a risk assessment at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the business environment or information systems. This risk assessment will identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on the organization's information assets. Due to the organization's low-risk profile, the focus will be on identifying readily addressable vulnerabilities and implementing proportionate controls. The risk assessment methodology will follow industry-recognized standards and will be documented. The results of the risk assessment will be used to inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls.

### 3. Data Protection

#### 3.1 Data Classification

All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. At a minimum, data will be classified as:

-   --Public:-- Data that is freely available and does not require protection.
-   --Internal:-- Data that is intended for internal use only and requires protection against unauthorized disclosure.
-   --Confidential:-- Data that requires the highest level of protection due to legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations, including PHI.

#### 3.2 Data Handling

Appropriate data handling procedures will be implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data throughout its lifecycle. These procedures will include:

-   Secure storage and disposal of physical and electronic media.
-   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit, where feasible.
-   Restrictions on the use of removable media.
-   Proper data retention and disposal policies.

#### 3.3 Data Backup and Recovery

Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored in a secure location. Backup procedures will be tested periodically to ensure data can be restored effectively in the event of a disaster or data loss incident. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested regularly.

### 4. Access Controls

#### 4.1 User Account Management

User accounts will be created and managed according to the principle of least privilege. Access to information systems and data will be granted only to authorized individuals based on their job responsibilities. User accounts will be reviewed regularly and disabled promptly upon termination or change in job role.

#### 4.2 Authentication

Strong passwords will be required for all user accounts. --Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all users accessing systems containing or transmitting PHI.-- Password policies will be enforced to ensure password complexity, length, and expiration.

#### 4.3 Access Monitoring

Access to information systems and data will be monitored and audited regularly. Specifically, the following logs will be reviewed:

-   --System access logs:-- To track login attempts, successful logins, and failed login attempts.
-   --Audit trails of PHI access:-- To monitor access, modification, and deletion of PHI data.
-   --Security event logs:-- To identify potential security incidents, such as malware infections or unauthorized access attempts.

These logs will be reviewed --weekly-- by the --IT Security Officer (or designated individual)--. Any suspicious activity will be investigated immediately.  A summary report of log review findings will be generated monthly and submitted to the Compliance Officer.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] will maintain an incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. The incident response plan will outline roles and responsibilities, communication procedures, and steps for containment, eradication, and recovery.

--5.1 Incident Types:--

The following are examples of incidents that may occur and require activation of the Incident Response Plan:

-   --Malware Infection:-- Detection of viruses, worms, ransomware, or other malicious software on any system.
-   --Data Breach:-- Unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of PHI or other sensitive data.
-   --Phishing Attack:-- Employees receiving fraudulent emails or other communications designed to steal credentials or install malware.
-   --Unauthorized Access:-- Attempts to access systems or data without proper authorization.
-   --Loss or Theft of Device:-- Loss or theft of laptops, mobile devices, or other equipment containing sensitive data.
-   --Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack:-- Attempts to disrupt the availability of systems or services.
-   --Insider Threat:--  Actions by employees or other insiders that could harm the organization's information security.

--5.2 Reporting Channels and Escalation Procedures:--

All employees will be trained on how to recognize and report security incidents. Suspected security incidents must be reported immediately to the --IT Help Desk-- via phone at [Phone Number] or email at [Email Address].

The IT Help Desk will document the incident and escalate it to the --IT Security Officer (or designated individual)-- for further investigation. If the incident involves a potential data breach or significant disruption to business operations, the IT Security Officer will immediately notify the --Compliance Officer-- and --[Designated Leadership Role, e.g., CEO, Practice Manager]--. A determination of whether the incident is a reportable breach will be made by the Compliance Officer in consultation with legal counsel, if needed, following HIPAA guidelines.

All employees will be trained on how to recognize and report security incidents. The incident response plan will be tested regularly through tabletop exercises or simulations.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees will receive security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training will cover topics such as data protection, password security, phishing awareness, and incident reporting. Training will be tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of employees and will be updated regularly to address emerging threats.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards, including ISO/IEC 27001. Regular internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and other relevant security requirements. External audits may be conducted periodically to provide independent assurance of the effectiveness of the organization's security controls. Audit findings will be documented and addressed promptly. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting [Organization Name]'s information assets and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and standards. By implementing these security controls, [Organization Name] can effectively mitigate the identified risks and maintain a strong security posture, appropriate for its low-risk environment, protecting patient data and maintaining the trust of its stakeholders. All personnel are responsible for adhering to this policy and reporting any security concerns to the appropriate authorities.
