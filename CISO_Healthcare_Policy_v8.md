## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security requirements for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within this organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using the organization's information systems, regardless of location. While this organization operates in a designated "Low Risk" environment, maintaining a proactive and responsible security posture is paramount to ensure patient safety, maintain public trust, and comply with applicable regulations. This policy is aligned with the principles of ISO/IEC 27001.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Recognizing the inherent, though currently assessed as low, risks associated with handling sensitive healthcare data, this organization will conduct periodic risk assessments, at least annually, to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on the organization's assets. These assessments will consider:

-   --Threats:-- Malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, insider threats, data breaches, and physical security incidents.
-   --Vulnerabilities:-- Weak passwords, unpatched software, inadequate access controls, and lack of security awareness.
-   --Impact:-- Data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, legal penalties, and disruption of patient care.

The risk assessment process will involve a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to prioritize risks and identify appropriate mitigation strategies. The results of these assessments will be documented and used to inform the development and implementation of security controls. Due to the low risk assessment, the primary focus will be on preventative measures and cost-effective controls.

### 3. Data Protection

This organization is committed to protecting PHI and other sensitive data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. PHI and other sensitive data will be clearly identified and handled according to its classification level.
-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored electronically will be encrypted at rest and in transit. This includes encryption of data on servers, workstations, laptops, and mobile devices. Transmission of PHI over public networks will be secured using strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site, following the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies of data, on 2 different media, with 1 copy offsite). Data recovery procedures will be documented and tested regularly to ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss event.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only the minimum necessary data will be collected, processed, and retained. Data retention policies will be established and enforced to ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary.
-   --Data Disposal:-- When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using approved methods, such as data sanitization or physical destruction of media.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and other sensitive data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- All users will be required to authenticate themselves using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible and appropriate, or other approved authentication methods.
-   --Authorization:-- Access to data and systems will be granted based on job roles and responsibilities. Access rights will be reviewed and updated regularly.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be created, modified, and terminated in a timely manner. Dormant accounts will be disabled or deleted.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Access control measures, such as keycard access or biometric authentication, will be implemented.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network and systems will be secured using VPNs or other approved remote access technologies. Remote access policies will be established and enforced.

### 5. Incident Response

This organization will establish and maintain an incident response plan to effectively respond to and recover from security incidents. The incident response plan will include:

-   --Incident Detection:-- Mechanisms for detecting security incidents, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, will be implemented where appropriate and cost effective.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees, contractors, and vendors will be required to report suspected security incidents to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Procedures for containing security incidents to prevent further damage or data loss will be established.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Steps for eradicating the root cause of security incidents will be defined.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures for restoring systems and data to their normal operating state will be established.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- After each security incident, a post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Communication Plan:-- A communication plan will detail how incident related communication will be relayed to internal stakeholders, law enforcement, media, and patients (if applicable).

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about security risks and best practices. The training will cover topics such as:

-   Password security
-   Phishing awareness
-   Malware prevention
-   Data protection
-   Access control
-   Incident reporting
-   Social engineering awareness

Security awareness training will be tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of employees. The effectiveness of the training will be evaluated through quizzes, simulations, and other methods.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

This organization will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA and ISO/IEC 27001, as related to data security and privacy. The following compliance and auditing activities will be conducted:

-   --Regular Security Audits:-- Internal and external security audits will be conducted regularly to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement. These audits will be less frequent and comprehensive than those conducted in higher-risk environments.
-   --Vulnerability Assessments:-- Regular vulnerability assessments will be conducted to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Periodic penetration testing will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the organization's security posture.
-   --Compliance Reporting:-- Regular compliance reports will be generated to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
-   --Policy Review:-- This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the organization's assets and maintaining the trust of our patients and stakeholders. By adhering to this policy, we can create a more secure environment for everyone. All employees, contractors, and vendors are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. The CISO is responsible for the development, implementation, and enforcement of this policy.
