## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards and guidelines for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and organizational assets. This policy is designed to address the specific cybersecurity risks present within our operational environment, which has been assessed as Low risk based on the limited scope of sensitive data handled and the nature of our operations. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that even in a Low risk environment, proactive security measures are essential to mitigate potential threats and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. All employees, contractors, volunteers, and other authorized users are required to adhere to this policy. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy is aligned with COBIT principles, focusing on value delivery, risk optimization, and resource management.

--2. Risk Assessment--

[Organization Name] recognizes the importance of proactively identifying and managing cybersecurity risks.

-   --Frequency:-- A formal risk assessment will be conducted annually, and whenever significant changes occur to our infrastructure, applications, or business processes.
-   --Scope:-- The risk assessment will cover all aspects of our IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, data, and personnel.
-   --Methodology:-- The risk assessment will leverage a qualitative approach based on common industry frameworks and the COBIT framework. It will involve:
    -   Identifying potential threats, such as phishing attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized access.
    -   Identifying vulnerabilities in our systems and processes.
    -   Assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk.
    -   Documenting the risk assessment findings, including identified risks, vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigation strategies.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Remediation efforts will focus on the highest-priority risks.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting patient data and other sensitive information is paramount.

-   --Data Classification:-- All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and regulatory requirements (e.g., confidential, internal, public). Clear data handling guidelines will be established for each classification.
-   --Data Storage:-- Sensitive data will be stored securely, using appropriate encryption and access controls. Data should be stored on secure, password-protected servers or cloud storage solutions approved by the IT department.
-   --Data Transmission:-- Sensitive data transmitted electronically will be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS, VPN).
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as required by legal, regulatory, or business needs. When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using approved methods (e.g., secure deletion, physical destruction).
-   --Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored in a secure, offsite location. Backup and recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to systems and data will be restricted to authorized users based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- All users will be required to authenticate themselves using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA) where technically feasible. Passwords must meet complexity requirements and be changed regularly.
-   --Access Provisioning and Deprovisioning:-- User accounts will be provisioned and deprovisioned promptly upon onboarding and termination of employment or contract. Regular reviews of user access privileges will be conducted to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access to systems and data will be granted based on user roles and responsibilities.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to servers, network equipment, and other critical infrastructure will be restricted to authorized personnel. Facilities will be secured with appropriate physical security measures (e.g., locks, access control systems, security cameras).
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network will be granted only to authorized users and will be secured using VPNs or other secure remote access technologies.

--5. Incident Response--

[Organization Name] will maintain an incident response plan to effectively respond to and recover from security incidents.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees, contractors, and volunteers are required to report any suspected security incidents immediately to the IT department or designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Response Team:-- A designated incident response team will be responsible for investigating and responding to security incidents.
-   --Incident Response Procedures:-- The incident response plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including:
    -   Identification and containment of the incident.
    -   Investigation of the incident.
    -   Eradication of the threat.
    -   Recovery of affected systems and data.
    -   Post-incident analysis and lessons learned.
-   --Incident Communication:-- Clear communication channels will be established for communicating with stakeholders during a security incident.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and volunteers will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices.

-   --Training Content:-- Training will cover topics such as:
    -   Phishing awareness.
    -   Malware prevention.
    -   Password security.
    -   Data protection.
    -   Social engineering.
    -   Incident reporting.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training will be conducted at least annually and upon onboarding.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training will be delivered through a variety of methods, such as online modules, in-person presentations, and simulated phishing exercises.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.

-   --COBIT Alignment:-- This cybersecurity policy is aligned with the COBIT framework, specifically focusing on principles related to governance and management of enterprise IT.
