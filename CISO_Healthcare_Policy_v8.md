## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security requirements for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data. This policy is designed to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) and applicable healthcare regulations, acknowledging our current assessment as a Low Risk environment. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other authorized users are required to adhere to this policy.

This policy provides a framework for establishing and maintaining a robust security posture, commensurate with the identified risks and the organization's operational environment. It focuses on implementing cost-effective and readily manageable security controls that provide reasonable assurance against common cybersecurity threats while minimizing disruption to business operations. Regular review and updates of this policy will ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] recognizes the importance of continuous risk assessment to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities.

-   --Annual Risk Assessment:-- A comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in the organization's environment (e.g., new systems, applications, or business processes).
-   --Scope:-- The risk assessment will cover all systems, networks, applications, and data stores that process, store, or transmit ePHI and other sensitive data.
-   --Methodology:-- The assessment will use a recognized framework, such as NIST RMF, tailored to the organization's size and complexity. In our low-risk environment, the assessment will focus on readily exploitable vulnerabilities and prevalent threats, like phishing and malware.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment findings, including identified threats, vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and recommended mitigation strategies, will be documented and maintained.
-   --Remediation:-- Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Remediation plans will be developed and implemented to address high-priority risks. For a Low Risk environment, remediation efforts will prioritize readily available and cost-effective solutions, such as patching critical vulnerabilities and implementing basic security awareness training.

### 3. Data Protection

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, especially ePHI.

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. ePHI will be classified as highly sensitive and will be subject to the most stringent protection measures. Other data will be classified according to its sensitivity.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes encrypting hard drives on laptops and desktops, encrypting data stored on servers, and using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for data transmission.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored in a secure, offsite location. Backup procedures will be tested regularly to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Measures will be implemented to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. This includes monitoring network traffic for sensitive data leaving the organization's network and implementing controls to prevent employees from accidentally or intentionally sharing sensitive data. In a Low Risk environment, this may involve simple endpoint monitoring rather than full-scale DLP solutions.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed. This includes securely wiping or destroying hard drives and other storage media.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel only.

-   --Principle of Least Privilege:-- Users will only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.
-   --User Authentication:-- Strong authentication methods will be used to verify the identity of users before granting them access to systems and data. This includes using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible and appropriate, and regularly reviewing user access rights.
-   --Access Control Lists (ACLs):-- Access to systems and data will be controlled using ACLs. ACLs will be reviewed regularly to ensure that they are up-to-date and accurate.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network will be secured using VPNs and other security measures. Remote access will be granted only to authorized personnel and will be subject to regular review.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel only.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] will maintain an incident response plan to effectively respond to security incidents.

-   --Incident Response Plan:-- A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed and maintained. The plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Analysis:-- All reported security incidents will be investigated and analyzed to determine the root cause and impact.
-   --Containment and Eradication:-- Measures will be taken to contain and eradicate security incidents as quickly as possible.
-   --Recovery:-- Systems and data will be recovered as quickly as possible following a security incident.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- A post-incident review will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve the organization's security posture.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

[Organization Name] will provide regular security awareness training to all employees.

-   --Training Content:-- Security awareness training will cover a variety of topics, including phishing, malware, password security, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training will be provided to all new employees upon hire and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Security awareness training will be delivered through a variety of methods, including online training, classroom training, and simulated phishing attacks. For a Low Risk environment, online training modules combined with regular security reminders may suffice.
-   --Training Tracking:-- Employee participation in security awareness training will be tracked and reported.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] will maintain compliance with all applicable healthcare regulations and industry standards, specifically RMF.

-   --RMF Compliance:-- This cybersecurity policy is aligned with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).
-   --Regular Audits:-- Regular security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the organization's security controls. These audits will be conducted by internal or external auditors.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans of systems and networks will be performed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Periodic penetration testing will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the organization's security posture. In a Low Risk environment, annual penetration testing may be replaced with regular vulnerability scanning and manual configuration reviews.
-   --Documentation:-- All compliance and audit activities will be documented and maintained.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI and other sensitive data at [Organization Name]. By adhering to this policy, all employees, contractors, vendors, and other authorized users contribute to maintaining a secure environment and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. This policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the organization's operational environment. The CISO is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this policy.
