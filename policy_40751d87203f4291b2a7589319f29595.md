**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2024-02-29
**Review Date:** 2025-02-28
**Applicability:** All employees, contractors, volunteers, and third-party vendors accessing or utilizing [Organization Name]'s information systems and data.

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the minimum security requirements for [Organization Name], a healthcare provider operating in a low-risk environment. This Policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and alignment with the principles outlined in ISO/IEC 27001. While operating in a low-risk environment allows for a streamlined approach, a robust security posture remains essential to maintain patient trust and operational efficiency. This policy addresses critical areas such as data protection, access control, incident response, and security awareness.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Organization Name] acknowledges the importance of ongoing risk assessment and mitigation. Given the low-risk environment, a simplified risk assessment process will be implemented and conducted annually. This process will involve:

*   **Asset Identification:** Identifying critical assets, including electronic medical records (EMRs), computer systems, network infrastructure, and physical locations where PHI is stored or processed.
*   **Threat Identification:** Identifying potential threats, such as malware infections, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, and physical security breaches.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Assessing vulnerabilities present in the identified assets, considering factors such as outdated software, weak passwords, and lack of security controls.
*   **Likelihood and Impact Assessment:** Determining the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact on [Organization Name]'s operations, reputation, and compliance.
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Developing and implementing mitigation strategies to address identified risks. These may include implementing technical controls, developing policies and procedures, and providing security awareness training.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and used to inform future security decisions and policy updates. The Risk Assessment will be led by [Designated Role, e.g., Practice Manager] and reviewed by [Designated Role, e.g., Medical Director].

**3. Data Protection**

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is paramount. This section outlines the requirements for protecting data at rest and in transit:

*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data stored on portable devices (laptops, tablets, USB drives) must be encrypted using approved encryption methods. Data at rest on servers and workstations should be encrypted where feasible and considered a best practice.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data must be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. Backup procedures must be documented and tested periodically to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner in the event of a disaster or data loss.
*   **Data Sanitization:** When disposing of electronic devices or storage media containing sensitive data, proper data sanitization techniques must be employed to prevent data breaches. Approved methods include physical destruction, data wiping, or degaussing.
*   **Data Transmission:** When transmitting sensitive data electronically, secure communication channels must be used, such as encrypted email, secure file transfer protocols (SFTP), or virtual private networks (VPNs). Avoid transmitting sensitive data over unencrypted channels.
*   **PHI Handling:** All employees must adhere to strict guidelines when handling PHI, including limiting access to only authorized personnel, storing PHI securely, and avoiding the disclosure of PHI to unauthorized individuals.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to information systems and data must be controlled to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. This section outlines the requirements for access control:

*   **User Authentication:** All users must be authenticated using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible. Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, mixed case, special characters) and be changed regularly.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access to information systems and data must be granted based on job roles and responsibilities. Users should only have access to the information they need to perform their duties.
*   **Least Privilege:** The principle of least privilege must be applied when granting access to information systems and data. Users should only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions.
*   **Access Revocation:** Access to information systems and data must be revoked promptly when an employee leaves the organization or changes roles.
*   **Account Monitoring:** User accounts and access logs should be monitored periodically for suspicious activity.
*   **Physical Access:** Physical access to areas where sensitive data is stored or processed must be restricted to authorized personnel. Access control measures may include keycard access, security cameras, and visitor logs.

**5. Incident Response**

In the event of a security incident, a swift and effective response is critical to minimize damage and prevent further breaches. This section outlines the requirements for incident response:

*   **Incident Identification:** All employees must be trained to recognize and report potential security incidents, such as malware infections, phishing attacks, or unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Security incidents must be reported to [Designated Role, e.g., IT Support, Practice Manager] immediately.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** A documented Incident Response Plan (IRP) must be in place to guide the response to security incidents. The IRP should outline the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, the steps to be taken to contain and eradicate the incident, and the procedures for restoring affected systems and data. This plan should be reviewed and tested annually.
*   **Incident Investigation:** Security incidents must be thoroughly investigated to determine the root cause and prevent recurrence.
*   **Post-Incident Review:** After a security incident, a post-incident review should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the incident response and identify areas for improvement.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

All employees must receive regular security awareness training to understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting information systems and data. This training will cover:

*   **Password Security:** Best practices for creating and managing strong passwords.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
*   **Malware Prevention:** Preventing malware infections.
*   **Data Security:** Handling sensitive data securely.
*   **Physical Security:** Maintaining physical security.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Reporting security incidents.
*   **Policy Compliance:** Understanding and complying with this Cybersecurity Policy.

Training will be conducted at least annually and upon onboarding. Records of training completion will be maintained.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including HIPAA and ISO/IEC 27001. This section outlines the requirements for compliance and auditing:

*   **Policy Review:** This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or organizational needs.
*   **Compliance Monitoring:** Regular monitoring will be conducted to ensure compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and other applicable security requirements.
