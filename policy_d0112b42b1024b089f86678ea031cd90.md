## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards and procedures necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using the organization's information systems and data, regardless of location or device. This policy aims to establish a security-conscious culture, mitigate potential risks, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF). While operating in a low-risk environment allows for a streamlined approach, maintaining vigilance and adhering to these policies is crucial for continuous improvement.

### 2. Risk Assessment

A formal risk assessment will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the organization's IT infrastructure, business operations, or regulatory landscape. This assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's information systems and data, analyze the likelihood and impact of identified risks, and determine appropriate security controls to mitigate those risks. The risk assessment process will follow the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidelines, specifically tailored for a low-risk environment. The outcome of the risk assessment will inform the development and implementation of security policies, procedures, and controls. Due to the low-risk profile, a focused assessment of readily available threat intelligence will be incorporated to maintain awareness of evolving risks. Remediation efforts will prioritize vulnerabilities with the highest potential impact, even within the context of a low-risk posture.

### 3. Data Protection

This organization is committed to protecting PHI and other sensitive data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Minimization:-- Collect, process, and retain only the minimum amount of PHI and other sensitive data necessary to achieve legitimate business purposes.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Implement encryption at rest and in transit for PHI and other sensitive data, as feasible. This includes encrypting hard drives, portable storage devices, and network communications.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regularly back up critical data and store backups in a secure, offsite location. Implement a documented data recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss incident. Testing of backups will occur at least annually.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Dispose of PHI and other sensitive data securely when it is no longer needed. This includes securely wiping hard drives, shredding paper documents, and sanitizing electronic media.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP measures, such as monitoring network traffic and endpoint activity, to prevent the unauthorized transmission of PHI and other sensitive data outside the organization. This will be implemented through periodic reviews of outgoing communications and file transfers.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or strong passwords, to verify the identity of users accessing the organization's information systems and data. Passwords must meet complexity requirements and be changed regularly.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Grant users only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties. Implement role-based access controls to simplify access management.
-   --Account Management:-- Establish a formal process for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts. Regularly review user access privileges to ensure they are still appropriate. Dormant accounts will be disabled or removed promptly.
-   --Physical Access Controls:-- Restrict physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other areas where PHI and other sensitive data is stored. Implement physical security measures, such as door locks, security cameras, and access badges.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access to the organization's network and data through VPNs or other secure methods. Enforce MFA for all remote access connections.

### 5. Incident Response

The organization will maintain a documented incident response plan to effectively respond to and recover from security incidents. The incident response plan will include the following elements:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Establish procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Take immediate steps to contain the impact of a security incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Remove the cause of the security incident and restore affected systems and data.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Restore affected systems and data to their normal operational state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Conduct a thorough analysis of the security incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls. This will be documented and used to update policies and procedures.
-   --Reporting:-- Report security incidents to appropriate authorities, such as law enforcement or regulatory agencies, as required by law.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training on an annual basis, or more frequently if required. The training will cover topics such as:

-   Data privacy and security policies and procedures.
-   Common threats and vulnerabilities, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering.
-   How to identify and report security incidents.
-   Best practices for protecting PHI and other sensitive data.
-   Password security and management.
-   Secure use of mobile devices and social media.
-   Consequences of violating security policies and procedures. The training program will be evaluated annually to ensure its effectiveness.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

The organization will conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and applicable laws and regulations, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

-   --Internal Audits:-- Conduct internal audits at least annually to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
-   --External Audits:-- Engage external auditors to conduct independent assessments of the organization's security posture.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Perform regular vulnerability scans of the organization's network and systems to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Conduct penetration testing on a periodic basis to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
-   --Log Monitoring:-- Implement log monitoring and analysis to detect suspicious activity and potential security incidents.

Audit findings will be reported to senior management and used to improve security policies, procedures, and controls.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the organization's information assets and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. All employees, contractors, and vendors are responsible for adhering to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities. While this policy is designed for a low-risk environment, continuous monitoring and improvement are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture and safeguarding sensitive information.
