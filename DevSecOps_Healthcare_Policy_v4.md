## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards required for all employees, contractors, and affiliates of [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy is designed to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule and other applicable regulations, tailored to a low-risk environment. All personnel are expected to adhere to this policy to ensure the security and privacy of our patients and organization. The policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address changes in technology, regulations, and threat landscape.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] conducts regular risk assessments to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems and PHI. These assessments are conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually, bi-annually] and include:

-   --Identification of Assets:-- Identifying all systems, devices, and data containing or transmitting PHI.
-   --Threat Assessment:-- Evaluating potential threats, such as malware, phishing, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, and security controls.
-   --Risk Analysis:-- Determining the likelihood and impact of identified threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Ranking risks based on severity and likelihood to focus mitigation efforts.
-   --Mitigation Planning:-- Developing and implementing security measures to reduce or eliminate identified risks.

Due to our low-risk environment, risk assessments will focus on readily available and easily implemented security controls. The organization acknowledges that while the risk posture is low, it is not zero, and these controls will be consistently reviewed.

### 3. Data Protection

Data protection measures are implemented to safeguard PHI and other sensitive information throughout its lifecycle, including creation, storage, transmission, and disposal.

-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored on electronic devices (laptops, desktops, mobile devices) should be encrypted using [Specify Encryption Standard e.g., AES-256]. Encryption during transmission is required for all external communications containing PHI (e.g., email, file transfer).
-   --Data Storage:-- PHI should be stored in secure locations with restricted access. Physical security measures include locked rooms or cabinets, and electronic security measures include access controls and encryption.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data, including PHI, are performed [Frequency - e.g., daily, weekly] and stored in a secure, offsite location. Recovery procedures are tested [Frequency - e.g., annually] to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner in the event of a disaster or data loss incident.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Electronic media containing PHI must be securely wiped or destroyed before disposal, using approved methods that meet or exceed [Specify Standard e.g., NIST 800-88]. Paper records containing PHI should be shredded.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Collect, use, and retain only the minimum necessary PHI required for business operations and patient care.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement basic DLP measures, such as monitoring outbound emails for sensitive information and restricting the transfer of PHI to unauthorized devices or locations.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and information systems is restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is encouraged where technically feasible and especially for remote access. Password requirements include: [Minimum length], [Complexity requirements: e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols], [Password change frequency: e.g., every 90 days].
-   --Access Authorization:-- User access rights are granted based on job roles and responsibilities. Access is reviewed [Frequency - e.g., annually] and adjusted as needed.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts are created, modified, and disabled promptly based on employee onboarding and offboarding processes. Dormant accounts are disabled or deleted after [Specify time period e.g., 90 days] of inactivity.
-   --Physical Access:-- Physical access to facilities and data centers is restricted through measures such as keycards, security badges, and visitor logs.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the network is permitted only through secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections. Remote access policies and procedures must be followed.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] has established an incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents that may compromise PHI or information systems.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All security incidents, including suspected breaches, must be reported immediately to the [Designated Incident Response Team/Person].
-   --Incident Investigation:-- The Incident Response Team will investigate all reported incidents to determine the scope, impact, and cause.
-   --Containment and Eradication:-- Measures will be taken to contain the incident, prevent further damage, and eradicate the threat.
-   --Recovery:-- Systems and data will be restored to normal operations as quickly as possible.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Breach Notification:-- In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, notification will be provided to affected individuals and regulatory authorities as required by HIPAA and other applicable laws.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and affiliates receive regular security awareness training to educate them on cybersecurity threats and best practices.

-   --Training Content:-- Training covers topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, incident reporting, and HIPAA compliance.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training is provided [Frequency - e.g., annually, upon hire, and whenever there are major security changes].
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training may be delivered through online modules, in-person sessions, or other methods.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Periodic phishing simulations are conducted to assess employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with HIPAA and other applicable regulations.

-   --Regular Audits:-- Internal audits are conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually] to assess compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Third-Party Assessments:-- Periodic security assessments are conducted by qualified third-party assessors to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.
-   --Policy Enforcement:-- This Cybersecurity Policy is enforced through disciplinary actions for non-compliance.
-   --Documentation:-- All security policies, procedures, and activities are documented and maintained for audit purposes.
-   --Business Associate Agreements (BAA):-- All business associates that handle PHI on behalf of [Organization Name] must sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) that requires them to comply with HIPAA Security Rule requirements.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI and other sensitive data at [Organization Name]. By adhering to this policy, all personnel contribute to maintaining a secure environment and complying with regulatory requirements. This policy will be continuously reviewed and updated to address evolving threats and ensure the ongoing security and privacy of our patients and organization.
