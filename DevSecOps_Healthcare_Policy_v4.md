Okay, I understand.  I will focus on replacing placeholders with specific, verifiable requirements, and incorporate all other feedback.

Here's the revised prompt, aiming for a cybersecurity policy that is more concrete and actionable, and addresses the remaining feedback:

--Revised Prompt:--

You are to generate a comprehensive cybersecurity policy for an organization that is subject to the Data Deletion and Retention Obligation (DDRO) standard (Assume a simplified version for demonstration purposes). The policy must address the following areas, incorporating the specifics outlined below, and address all feedback from the previous review:

--1. Purpose:--

-   State the purpose of the cybersecurity policy, which is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's information assets and to ensure compliance with the DDRO.
-   Emphasize the importance of data security, access control, incident response, and risk management.

--2. Scope:--

-   Define the scope of the policy, which includes all employees, contractors, vendors, and other third parties who have access to the organization's information assets.
-   Specify that the policy applies to all information assets, including data, systems, networks, and physical facilities.

--3. Risk Assessment:--

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identify and classify all critical assets, including servers, databases, workstations, network devices, and data repositories. -Example: All servers hosting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be classified as High Criticality and documented in the Asset Inventory maintained by the IT Department.-
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identify potential threats to the organization's information assets, including malware, phishing, ransomware, insider threats, and physical security breaches. -Example: Regularly review threat intelligence feeds from [Specific Provider Name] to identify emerging threats targeting the healthcare industry.-
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in the organization's systems and applications using [Specific Vulnerability Scanner Name].
    -   Vulnerability scans will be performed at least quarterly on all critical systems.
    -   High-severity vulnerabilities will be remediated within 30 days.
    -   Medium-severity vulnerabilities will be remediated within 90 days.
    -   Low-severity vulnerabilities will be addressed during scheduled maintenance windows.
-   --Risk Treatment:-- Detail risk treatment strategies, specifying risk acceptance for "Low Risk" categorizations. Given the organization's risk profile as a low-risk entity, risks categorized as 'Low' will be accepted with continuous monitoring.
-   --Regular Updates:-- Risk assessments will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if there are significant changes to the organization's environment or threat landscape.

--4. Data Protection:--

-   --Data Minimization:-- Limit the collection and retention of personal data to what is necessary for specific, legitimate purposes. Implement processes to regularly review and delete unnecessary data.
-   --Encryption:-- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    -   All laptops and mobile devices will be encrypted using [Specific Encryption Software Name].
    -   Data in transit over public networks will be protected using TLS 1.3 or higher.
    -   Compliance with [DDRO Section 3.2.a - Encryption of PHI: All PHI stored electronically must be encrypted using AES-256 or a stronger algorithm approved by the Data Security Board].
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP solutions to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. DLP will monitor outbound email for attachments containing social security numbers, patient names, and medical record numbers. DLP events will be reviewed daily by the Security Team.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Implement regular data backups and recovery procedures to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster. Backups will be stored offsite and tested quarterly. The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for critical systems is 4 hours, and the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is 1 hour.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Establish data retention and disposal policies to ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary and is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed. Compliance with [DDRO Section 4.1.b - Data Retention: Personal data shall not be retained for longer than 7 years after the last date of service]. Secure data destruction methods will be used, such as data wiping or physical destruction of storage media.
-   --Physical Record Security:-- Physical records containing sensitive information will be stored in locked cabinets and access will be limited to authorized personnel. Physical records will be shredded when they are no longer needed.

--5. Access Control:--

-   --Strong Authentication:-- Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for all users. All users will be required to use MFA for access to corporate email, VPN, and critical applications using [Specific MFA Solution Name].
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Implement RBAC to ensure that users only have access to the information and resources they need to perform their job duties. User access will be reviewed quarterly by department managers.
-   --Access Reviews:-- Conduct regular access reviews to ensure that user access is still appropriate and necessary. The IT Department will conduct access reviews quarterly.
-   --Privileged Access Management (PAM):-- Implement PAM solutions to control and monitor access to privileged accounts using [Specific PAM Solution Name].
-   --Account Management:-- Implement procedures for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts. Employee accounts will be disabled within 24 hours of termination.

--6. Incident Response:--

-   A comprehensive incident response plan will be maintained to address security incidents in a timely and effective manner. The plan will be tested annually through tabletop exercises. This aligns with [DDRO Incident Reporting requirements, e.g., DDRO Section 5.1.a - All breaches of PHI affecting more than 500 individuals must be reported to the DDRO within 60 days of discovery]. The plan will include:

    -   --Incident Severity Levels:-- Incidents will be classified into the following severity levels:
        -   Critical: Confirmed breach of PHI affecting more than 500 individuals, system-wide ransomware infection, or significant disruption of critical business operations. Response: Immediate notification of Privacy Officer and regulatory agencies (if applicable), activation of the Incident Response Team, and implementation of containment measures.
        -   High: Confirmed breach of PHI affecting fewer than 500 individuals, targeted malware infection, or significant vulnerability identified in a critical system. Response: Activation of the Incident Response Team, implementation of containment measures, and remediation of the vulnerability.
        -   Medium: Suspected breach of PHI, minor malware infection, or vulnerability identified in a non-critical system. Response: Investigation by the IT Security Team, implementation of containment measures (if necessary), and remediation of the vulnerability.
