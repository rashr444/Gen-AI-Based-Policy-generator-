## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards and procedures that [Organization Name] must adhere to in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy is designed to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule and is tailored to the organization's assessment as a low-risk environment. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals accessing or using [Organization Name]'s systems and data are required to comply with this policy. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as required by changes in regulations, technology, or business operations.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] recognizes the importance of regularly assessing potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. As a low-risk environment, our risk assessment process is streamlined but comprehensive. This includes:

-   --Annual Security Risk Assessment:-- A formal risk assessment will be conducted annually to identify potential risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. This assessment will consider physical, technical, and administrative safeguards.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Periodic vulnerability scans of critical systems will be performed to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
-   --Threat Monitoring:-- Basic threat intelligence feeds will be monitored to stay informed about emerging threats relevant to the healthcare sector.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Remediation efforts will be focused on addressing the highest-priority risks.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment activities, findings, and remediation plans will be thoroughly documented.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. [Organization Name] employs the following data protection measures:

-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored at rest (e.g., on hard drives, databases) will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data transmitted over public networks will also be encrypted using secure protocols such as HTTPS and VPNs.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Basic DLP measures will be implemented to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This may include monitoring email communications and file transfers for sensitive data.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. A data recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster or system failure.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only the minimum necessary PHI will be collected, used, and disclosed. Data retention policies will be implemented to ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary for business or legal purposes.
-   --Secure Disposal:-- Electronic media containing PHI will be securely wiped or physically destroyed before disposal. Paper records containing PHI will be shredded or incinerated.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for all user accounts. Default passwords must be changed immediately upon initial login.
-   --Access Control Lists (ACLs):-- Access to systems and data will be controlled through ACLs, which specify which users or groups have permission to access specific resources.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- User access privileges will be assigned based on their job roles and responsibilities.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and terminated as needed. Regular reviews of user access privileges will be conducted to ensure that they remain appropriate.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted through measures such as locked doors, security cameras, and access control badges.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] maintains an incident response plan to effectively handle security incidents and data breaches.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the designated security point of contact ([Security Officer Name/Title]).
-   --Incident Response Team:-- An incident response team will be responsible for investigating and responding to security incidents.
-   --Incident Classification:-- Incidents will be classified based on their severity and impact.
-   --Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:-- The incident response team will take steps to contain the incident, eradicate the threat, and recover affected systems and data.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- After each incident, a post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and implement measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
-   --Notification Procedures:-- In the event of a data breach affecting PHI, notification procedures will be followed in accordance with HIPAA regulations and applicable state laws.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training to educate them about security risks and best practices.

-   --Initial Training:-- New employees will receive security awareness training as part of their onboarding process.
-   --Annual Training:-- All employees will receive annual security awareness training to reinforce key security concepts.
-   --Training Content:-- Training content will cover topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Periodic phishing simulations may be conducted to test employees' ability to identify and report phishing emails.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.

-   --HIPAA Compliance:-- This policy is designed to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule. Regular audits will be conducted to assess compliance with HIPAA requirements.
-   --Policy Enforcement:-- This policy will be enforced through a combination of technical controls, administrative procedures, and disciplinary actions.
-   --Audit Trail:-- Audit logs will be maintained to track user activity and system events. These logs will be reviewed periodically to detect potential security breaches or policy violations.
-   --Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in regulations, technology, or business operations.
