## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organization (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security measures required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, acknowledging the nature of our operations and associated threats. It is aligned with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity guidelines and is mandatory for all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or handle organizational data. The policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address changes in technology, regulations, and threat landscape.

### 2. Risk Assessment

A risk assessment will be conducted annually to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our systems and data. This assessment will consider the likelihood and impact of various risks, including but not limited to:

-   --Data breaches:-- Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of ePHI.
-   --Malware infections:-- Viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software that can disrupt operations and compromise data.
-   --Insider threats:-- Unauthorized actions by employees or contractors.
-   --Physical security breaches:-- Theft or damage to IT equipment and facilities.

Based on the risk assessment, appropriate security controls will be implemented and prioritized. Given the low-risk environment designation, the focus will be on implementing fundamental security controls to mitigate the most common and easily exploitable risks.

### 3. Data Protection

All ePHI and other sensitive data will be protected through appropriate security measures, including:

-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption of data at rest and in transit, using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Specifically, encryption will be enforced on all portable devices and storage media containing ePHI.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely offsite. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically to ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss incident.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Limit the collection and retention of ePHI to only what is necessary for business purposes. Securely dispose of data that is no longer needed in accordance with data retention policies and applicable regulations.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement basic DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel only, based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords will be required for all user accounts. Multifactor authentication (MFA) will be implemented for all privileged accounts.
-   --Access Authorization:-- User access rights will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that individuals only have access to the data and systems they need to perform their job duties. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented where feasible.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to organizational resources will be secured through the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and multifactor authentication.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted through the use of access cards, security cameras, and other physical security measures.

### 5. Incident Response

A documented incident response plan will be maintained and tested regularly to ensure that the organization can effectively respond to and recover from security incidents.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the designated security contact.
-   --Incident Response Team:-- An incident response team will be established to investigate and respond to security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Procedures will be in place to contain the spread of security incidents.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Procedures will be in place to remove the cause of security incidents.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures will be in place to restore systems and data to a normal operating state.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- After an incident, it will be analyzed, lessons learned will be documented, and policies and procedures will be updated as necessary.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about security threats and best practices.

-   --Training Topics:-- Training topics will include password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training will be provided to all new hires and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training will be delivered through a combination of online modules, instructor-led sessions, and awareness campaigns.
-   --Training Records:-- Records of security awareness training will be maintained to demonstrate compliance.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including NIST guidelines.

-   --Regular Audits:-- Periodic security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Vulnerability Management:-- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing will be performed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Security Configuration Management:-- Security configurations will be standardized and enforced across all systems.
-   --Logging and Monitoring:-- Security logs will be collected and monitored to detect suspicious activity and security incidents.
-   --Documentation:-- Comprehensive documentation of security policies, procedures, and controls will be maintained.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is critical to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI and other sensitive data within our organization. All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors are expected to comply with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. The organization is committed to continuous improvement of its security posture and will regularly review and update this policy to address evolving threats and regulatory requirements.
