## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security practices and controls required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy is designed to meet the requirements of applicable regulations, including but not limited to the Digital Data Risk Ordinance (DDRO), and is tailored for a low-risk environment. All employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals accessing or using the organization's information systems and data must adhere to this policy. This policy is a living document and will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as required by changes in regulations, technology, or the organization's risk profile.

--2. Risk Assessment--

A comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted at least annually to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's information assets. Given the low-risk environment, the assessment will focus on common and easily mitigated risks, such as phishing attacks, weak passwords, and unpatched software. The risk assessment process will involve:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying and categorizing all information assets, including hardware, software, data, and systems.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities, such as malware, ransomware, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
-   --Risk Analysis:-- Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks to determine their overall severity.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritizing risks based on their severity to guide the implementation of appropriate security controls.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and used to inform the development and implementation of security controls and procedures.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting ePHI and other sensitive data is paramount. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- ePHI and other sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes encrypting data stored on laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile devices, as well as data transmitted over networks.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only collect, use, and retain the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve the intended purpose. Regularly review data retention policies and securely dispose of data that is no longer needed.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Implement a robust data backup and recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or data loss. Backups will be performed regularly and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. Test the data recovery process regularly to ensure its effectiveness.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This may include monitoring network traffic, blocking unauthorized data transfers, and educating employees about data handling procedures.
-   --Physical Security:-- Protect physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other locations where sensitive data is stored. Implement physical security controls such as access controls, surveillance cameras, and environmental monitoring.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel only. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --Least Privilege:-- Grant users only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties. Regularly review user access privileges and revoke access when it is no longer needed.
-   --Strong Passwords:-- Enforce the use of strong passwords that meet minimum complexity requirements and are changed regularly. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing sensitive systems and data.
-   --Account Management:-- Implement a process for creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. Disable inactive accounts promptly.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Assign access rights based on job roles rather than individual users. This simplifies access management and ensures that users have the appropriate level of access based on their responsibilities.
-   --Audit Trails:-- Maintain audit trails of all access to ePHI and other sensitive data. Regularly review audit logs to detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.

--5. Incident Response--

A documented incident response plan will be maintained to address security incidents and data breaches promptly and effectively. The plan will include:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Containment:-- Steps to contain the impact of a security incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Eradication:-- Procedures for removing the cause of the security incident.
-   --Recovery:-- Steps to restore affected systems and data to their normal state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A review of the incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Reporting:-- Procedures for reporting security incidents to relevant authorities, as required by law and regulation.

The incident response plan will be tested regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity risks and best practices. The training will cover topics such as:

-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Password Security:-- Creating and maintaining strong passwords.
-   --Data Handling:-- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and disclosure.
-   --Social Engineering:-- Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
-   --Mobile Security:-- Protecting mobile devices and data.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Procedures for reporting security incidents.

Training will be tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of different user groups.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including DDRO. Regular audits will be conducted to verify compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement. These audits will include:

-   --Policy Review:-- Reviewing the policy to ensure it is up-to-date and aligned with current regulations and best practices.
-   --Technical Assessments:-- Conducting vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify weaknesses in systems and applications.
-   --Compliance Audits:-- Assessing compliance with specific regulations, such as DDRO.
-   --Third-Party Audits:-- Engaging independent third-party auditors to assess the organization's security posture.

Audit findings will be documented and used to develop corrective action plans.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting ePHI and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. By implementing the security controls and procedures outlined in this policy, the organization can mitigate cybersecurity risks and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. All personnel are responsible for adhering to this policy and contributing to a secure environment. Continued vigilance, training, and adherence to this policy will help ensure the ongoing protection of sensitive information and the trust of our patients and stakeholders.
