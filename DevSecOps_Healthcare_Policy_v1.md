## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organization (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security controls and practices for [Organization Name], a healthcare provider operating in a low-risk environment. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices, including NIST Cybersecurity Framework. All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or use [Organization Name]'s information systems are required to adhere to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

--2. Risk Assessment--

A risk assessment will be conducted annually to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to the organization's information systems and data. The risk assessment will consider factors such as:

-   --Threats:-- Malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, insider threats, data breaches, and physical security incidents.
-   --Vulnerabilities:-- Weak passwords, unpatched software, insecure network configurations, lack of access controls, and inadequate security awareness training.
-   --Impact:-- Potential harm to patients, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal or regulatory penalties.

The results of the risk assessment will be used to prioritize security efforts and allocate resources effectively. As the risk profile is low, the organization will focus on foundational cybersecurity controls and best practices. Risk assessment reports will be reviewed and approved by the [Designated Security Officer/Committee].

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification:-- All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Data classification levels will include:

-   --Public:-- Information that is freely available and does not require protection.
-   --Internal:-- Information that is intended for internal use only and should not be shared with unauthorized individuals.
-   --Confidential:-- Information that requires a high level of protection due to its sensitivity (e.g., PHI, financial data).

--3.2 Data Encryption:-- Confidential data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Encryption keys will be securely managed and stored.

--3.3 Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular data backups will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backups will be stored in a secure location, separate from the primary data storage. The recovery process will be tested periodically.

--3.4 Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement basic DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This may include monitoring email communications, restricting access to removable media, and educating users about data handling procedures.

--4. Access Controls--

--4.1 User Account Management:--

-   Unique user accounts will be created for each individual accessing the organization's information systems.
-   User accounts will be disabled or terminated promptly upon employee departure or change in job responsibilities.
-   Generic or shared accounts are prohibited.

--4.2 Password Management:--

-   Users will be required to create strong passwords that meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols).
-   Passwords will be changed periodically (at least every 90 days).
-   Password reuse is prohibited.
-   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented for all critical systems and applications where feasible, given the risk profile.

--4.3 Least Privilege:-- Access to information systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.

--4.4 Access Reviews:-- Periodic access reviews will be conducted to ensure that users have appropriate access privileges.

--5. Incident Response--

--5.1 Incident Reporting:-- All security incidents (e.g., suspected malware infection, data breach, unauthorized access) must be reported immediately to the [Designated Security Officer/Incident Response Team].

--5.2 Incident Response Plan:-- An incident response plan will be maintained and regularly tested to ensure that the organization can effectively respond to and recover from security incidents. The plan will outline the roles and responsibilities of incident response team members, as well as the steps to be taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents.

--5.3 Incident Analysis and Remediation:-- All security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to determine the root cause and prevent future occurrences. Corrective actions will be taken to address identified vulnerabilities and improve security controls.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

--6.1 Training Program:-- All employees will be required to participate in security awareness training annually. The training will cover topics such as:

-   Password security
-   Phishing awareness
-   Malware prevention
-   Data handling procedures
-   Incident reporting
-   Social Engineering

--6.2 Ongoing Awareness:-- Security awareness messages and reminders will be communicated to employees on a regular basis to reinforce security best practices.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

--7.1 NIST Cybersecurity Framework:-- This policy is aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The organization will use the framework to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.

--7.2 Regular Audits:-- Periodic security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls and ensure compliance with this policy and applicable regulations. Internal audits will be conducted [Annually/Bi-annually]. External audits will be considered based on business needs and regulatory requirements.

--7.3 Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of [Organization Name]'s commitment to protecting patient data and maintaining the trust of its stakeholders. By adhering to the policies and procedures outlined in this document, all members of the organization contribute to a secure and compliant environment. Continued vigilance, education, and improvement are essential to maintaining a strong security posture.
