## Cybersecurity Policy for a Low-Risk Financial Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for all information systems and data within [Organization Name], a financial institution operating in a low-risk environment. This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our assets while adhering to relevant compliance standards, specifically the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing, processing, or storing organizational data. A low-risk environment, in this context, implies that the organization's systems and data are not subject to high-value transactions or sensitive customer information that would typically be targeted by sophisticated threat actors. However, a foundational level of cybersecurity is still critical to prevent basic attacks and ensure business continuity.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] will conduct periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems. These assessments will:

-   Identify critical assets and data.
-   Identify potential threats (e.g., malware, phishing, data breaches, insider threats).
-   Identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and processes.
-   Assess the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact on the organization.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks.

Risk assessments will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur in the threat landscape, business operations, or technology infrastructure.

### 3. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) governs the use of [Organization Name]'s information resources, including but not limited to computers, networks, internet access, email, software, and data. All users are responsible for using these resources responsibly and ethically.
