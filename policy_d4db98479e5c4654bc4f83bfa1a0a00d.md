## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environments

**Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Effective Date:** November 9, 2023
**Policy Owner:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum cybersecurity requirements for [Organization Name], a healthcare organization operating in a low-risk environment. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency. This policy is aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, acknowledging the principles and best practices for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). While recognizing the low-risk nature of the environment, this policy establishes foundational security measures to mitigate potential threats and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

**Policy Scope:** This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals who have access to [Organization Name]'s systems, networks, and data. This policy covers all physical locations, devices, and digital assets owned or managed by [Organization Name].

**2. Risk Assessment**

Given the low-risk environment assessment, [Organization Name] acknowledges a reduced probability and impact of potential cybersecurity threats. However, a basic risk assessment will be conducted annually and updated as needed, identifying vulnerabilities and potential threats relevant to our operations. The risk assessment will consider:

*   **Data Classification:** Identifying and classifying data based on its sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted PHI).  All PHI, regardless of classification, will receive specific protection as described in the Data Protection section.
*   **Asset Identification:** Identifying and inventorying all critical IT assets, including hardware, software, and data.
*   **Threat Identification:** Identifying potential threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Assessing vulnerabilities in systems and processes that could be exploited by threats.
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Prioritizing identified risks based on likelihood and potential impact, focusing on mitigating high-priority risks first.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Developing and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels.

The CISO will oversee the risk assessment process and ensure that identified risks are addressed appropriately. Risk assessments will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.

**3. Data Protection**

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, especially Protected Health Information (PHI). The following data protection measures will be implemented:

*   **Data Encryption:**  PHI stored on portable devices (e.g., laptops, USB drives) must be encrypted using approved encryption methods. For other devices encryption is recommended, but not mandatory.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:**  Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored in a secure location. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically.
*   **Data Minimization:**  [Organization Name] will only collect and retain data necessary for legitimate business purposes.
*   **Data Disposal:**  Data will be securely disposed of when no longer needed, following established procedures (e.g., secure wiping of hard drives, shredding of physical documents).
*   **PHI Protection:** Strict adherence to HIPAA regulations and other relevant data privacy laws regarding the handling of PHI. This includes limiting access to PHI to authorized personnel, implementing appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure, and responding to data breaches in a timely manner.
*   **Acceptable Use:** Clearly defined policies governing the acceptable use of company resources, including restrictions on downloading unauthorized software, accessing inappropriate websites, and sharing sensitive information.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to systems, networks, and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the access necessary to perform their job duties. The following access control measures will be implemented:

*   **User Authentication:** Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended, but not required, for access to sensitive systems.
*   **Access Reviews:** User access privileges will be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain appropriate.
*   **Account Management:**  User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and disabled as needed. Departing employees' access will be terminated immediately upon termination of employment.
*   **Physical Security:** Physical access to server rooms and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel.
*   **Remote Access:**  Remote access to the network will be granted only to authorized personnel and will be secured using a VPN or other approved method.

**5. Incident Response**

An incident response plan (IRP) will be maintained to address cybersecurity incidents effectively. The IRP will outline procedures for:

*   **Incident Detection:**  Identifying and reporting potential security incidents.
*   **Incident Containment:**  Isolating and containing the impact of an incident.
*   **Incident Eradication:**  Removing the cause of the incident.
*   **Incident Recovery:**  Restoring systems and data to normal operation.
*   **Post-Incident Analysis:**  Analyzing the incident to identify root causes and prevent future occurrences.
*   **Reporting:** Documenting all incidents and reporting them to the appropriate authorities as required by law.

The IRP will be reviewed and tested annually.  Employees will be trained on their roles and responsibilities in the IRP.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

All employees will receive initial and ongoing security awareness training to educate them on cybersecurity threats and best practices. The training will cover topics such as:

*   **Phishing Awareness:** Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
*   **Password Security:** Creating strong passwords and protecting them.
*   **Malware Prevention:**  Avoiding malware infections.
*   **Data Protection:**  Protecting sensitive data.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
*   **Incident Reporting:**  Reporting suspicious activity.
*   **Acceptable Use Policy:** Understanding and adhering to the organization's acceptable use policy.
*   **Physical Security:**  Practicing good physical security habits.

Training will be conducted at least annually and will be updated to reflect emerging threats and best practices.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

[Organization Name] will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA and other relevant privacy laws. The organization will conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with this policy and other security standards.

*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape or regulatory requirements.
*   **Internal Audits:** Internal audits will be conducted periodically to assess compliance with this policy.
*   **External Audits:** External audits may be conducted to assess compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
*   **Documentation:** All security policies, procedures, and audit results will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets in a low-risk healthcare environment. By adhering to this policy, [Organization Name] can mitigate potential cybersecurity risks, maintain compliance with applicable regulations, and ensure the continued delivery of quality healthcare services. The CISO is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this policy. Any questions or concerns regarding this policy should be directed to the CISO. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
