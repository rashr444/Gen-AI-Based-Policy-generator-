Okay, here's a comprehensive cybersecurity policy revised based on your feedback, aiming for a "low-risk" environment in the IT industry and alignment with ISO/IEC 27001. I've addressed the specifics you highlighted in your evaluation.

--Cybersecurity Policy--

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the principles, standards, and procedures that [Company Name] follows to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets.  This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Company Name]'s information systems, networks, and data, regardless of location.

The purpose of this policy is to:

-   Establish a framework for managing cybersecurity risks.
-   Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
-   Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including alignment with ISO/IEC 27001.
-   Maintain the trust of our customers, partners, and stakeholders.

While [Company Name] operates in a low-risk environment, proactive cybersecurity measures are essential to prevent and mitigate potential threats. This policy is reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to adapt to evolving threats and business changes.

--2. Risk Assessment--

[Company Name] recognizes the importance of identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Our risk assessment process is designed to be consistent with ISO/IEC 27005 guidelines.

-   --Methodology:-- We utilize a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology. This involves:
    -   --Asset Identification:--  Identifying critical information assets, including data, systems, and networks.
    -   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in our assets. This includes malware, phishing, social engineering, and unauthorized access.
    -   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Evaluating weaknesses in our systems and processes that could be exploited by threats.
    -   --Impact Analysis:-- Assessing the potential impact of a successful attack, considering factors such as financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and operational disruption.
    -   --Likelihood Assessment:-- Determining the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
    -   --Risk Scoring:-- Combining impact and likelihood to assign a risk score to each identified risk.
-   --Risk Register:--  A Risk Register is maintained to document identified risks, their potential impact, likelihood, assigned risk scores, and mitigation strategies.
-   --Roles and Responsibilities:--
    -   --IT Department:-- Responsible for conducting regular risk assessments, implementing security controls, and monitoring for security incidents.
    -   --Management Team:--  Responsible for reviewing and approving risk assessment results, allocating resources for risk mitigation, and ensuring compliance with this policy.
    -   --All Employees:-- Responsible for reporting any suspected security vulnerabilities or incidents.
-   --Risk Appetite and Tolerance:-- [Company Name] has a -conservative- risk appetite. We aim to minimize exposure to cybersecurity risks and are willing to invest resources to mitigate potential threats, even those with low likelihood. Our risk tolerance is defined as the acceptable level of residual risk -after- implementing mitigation measures. Specific risk tolerance levels are documented within the Risk Register for each asset. This tolerance will be reassessed and changed upon new threat information.
-   --Regular Assessments:-- Risk assessments are conducted at least annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to our business operations, technology infrastructure, or threat landscape. Penetration tests and vulnerability scans are conducted quarterly, or sooner if there is a new, critical vulnerability is discovered.
-   --Low-Risk Environment Considerations:--  While we classify our environment as "low-risk," this refers to the -inherent risk- based on the nature of our business and the sensitivity of our data. However, we acknowledge that even low-risk environments are susceptible to attacks, and this policy implements appropriate security controls to mitigate those risks.

--3. Data Protection--

[Company Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data entrusted to us.

-   --Data Classification:--  Data is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality to the organization.  Classifications include:
    -   --Public:-- Information freely available to the public.
    -   --Internal:-- Information intended for internal use only.
    -   --Confidential:-- Sensitive information that requires strict protection, such as customer data, financial records, and trade secrets.
-   --Data Handling Procedures:--  Specific procedures are in place for handling each data classification. These procedures address:
    -   --Storage:--  Where data can be stored (e.g., encrypted hard drives, secure cloud storage).
    -   --Transmission:--  How data can be transmitted (e.g., encrypted email, secure file transfer protocols).
    -   --Access:-- Who has access to data (see Section 4, Access Controls).
    -   --Disposal:--  How data is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed (e.g., secure data wiping, physical destruction of media).
-   --Encryption:-- Encryption is used to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.  Specific encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) are used for data stored on servers and workstations. All network traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:--  Regular backups are performed to ensure data can be recovered in the event of a disaster or data loss. Backup data is stored in a secure, offsite location.  Backup and recovery procedures are tested regularly.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- DLP tools and processes are used to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization without authorization.
-   --Privacy:-- [Company Name] complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.  A Privacy Policy is maintained to inform individuals about how their personal information is collected, used, and protected.

--4. Access Controls--

[Company Name] implements robust access controls to restrict access to information systems and data to authorized users only.

-   --Least Privilege:--  Users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their job duties.
-   --Strong Authentication:-- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all users accessing internal systems and data remotely, and for privileged accounts accessing sensitive systems. MFA leverages technologies such as:
    -   Authenticator Apps (e.g. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
    -   Hardware Tokens (e.g. YubiKey)
    -   SMS-based Verification (used as a last resort)
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):--  Access rights are assigned based on job roles, rather than individual users. This simplifies access management and ensures consistency.
-   --Privileged Access Management (PAM):-- PAM solutions are used to control and monitor access to privileged accounts. This includes:
    -   Secure storage and rotation of privileged credentials.
    -   Auditing of privileged user activity.
    -   Just-in-time (JIT) access provisioning.
-   --Password Management:--
    -   --Complexity:-- Passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:
        -   Minimum length of 12 characters.
        -   Include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        -   Not be based on personal information (e.g., names, birthdays).
        -   Not be reused from previous passwords.
    -   --Expiration:-- Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
    -   --Storage:-- Passwords must be stored securely using a strong hashing algorithm.
-   --Access Logging and Monitoring:-- All access to information systems and data is logged and monitored for suspicious activity. Logs are reviewed regularly to identify potential security incidents. Access logs are retained for at least 12 months.
-   --Account Management:--
    -   User accounts are created and managed through a centralized identity management system.
    -   New accounts are created only after proper authorization.
    -   Accounts are disabled promptly when employees leave the organization or change roles.
    -   Inactive accounts are automatically disabled after 90 days of inactivity.
-   --Network Segmentation:-- Networks are segmented to isolate critical systems and data from less secure areas. Firewalls and other security controls are used to restrict traffic between network segments.
