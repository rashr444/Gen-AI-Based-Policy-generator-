## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Effective Date:** [Date of Implementation]
**Approved By:** [Your Name/Title, CISO]

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy (the “Policy”) outlines the minimum-security requirements for [Organization Name], a healthcare organization operating in a low-risk environment. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data, ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, specifically ISO/IEC 27001. While operating in a low-risk environment, [Organization Name] recognizes the inherent risks associated with handling sensitive data and is committed to implementing reasonable and appropriate security controls. This policy provides a framework for security management and informs all employees, contractors, and third-party partners of their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment.

**2. Risk Assessment**

A risk assessment will be conducted annually or more frequently if significant changes occur within the organization's operations or technology landscape. The risk assessment process will:

*   **Identify Assets:** Catalog all hardware, software, and data assets that fall under the scope of this policy.
*   **Identify Threats:** Determine potential threats to the organization's assets, considering both internal and external sources, including malware, phishing, data breaches, and human error.
*   **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Identify existing vulnerabilities in the organization's systems, applications, and processes.
*   **Assess Likelihood and Impact:** Evaluate the likelihood of identified threats exploiting identified vulnerabilities and the potential impact on the organization, including financial, reputational, and legal consequences.
*   **Determine Risk Level:** Based on the likelihood and impact assessment, determine the overall risk level for each identified risk.
*   **Prioritize Risks:** Prioritize risks based on their level of severity and implement mitigation strategies accordingly.
*   **Document Findings:** Document the entire risk assessment process, including the identification of assets, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, risk levels, and mitigation strategies.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

In a low-risk environment, mitigation strategies will primarily focus on foundational security controls and employee awareness. Examples include:

*   Implementing basic access controls (see Section 4).
*   Regular software updates and patching.
*   Deployment of basic anti-malware software.
*   Employee training on phishing and social engineering tactics (see Section 6).
*   Secure disposal of sensitive data.

**3. Data Protection**

All data, especially PHI, must be handled with appropriate care and protection. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

*   **Data Classification:** Classify data based on its sensitivity and criticality (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted). PHI will be classified as confidential or restricted and will be subject to the highest level of protection.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data at rest (e.g., on hard drives, USB drives) and in transit (e.g., during email communication) should be encrypted where feasible and practical, considering the low-risk environment. At a minimum, strong passwords should be required for accessing any electronic devices containing PHI.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up critical data, including PHI, to an offsite location or cloud-based service. Test the backup and recovery process regularly to ensure data can be restored in the event of a disaster.
*   **Data Disposal:** Securely dispose of data that is no longer needed, following established procedures. Paper records should be shredded, and electronic data should be securely wiped or physically destroyed.
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement basic DLP measures, such as monitoring outbound email for sensitive data and educating employees on the risks of data leakage.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to systems and data should be restricted based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the access necessary to perform their job functions.

*   **User Account Management:** Establish a process for creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts.  Ensure timely termination of access when employees leave the organization.
*   **Password Policy:** Implement a strong password policy that requires users to create complex passwords, change them regularly, and avoid reusing passwords.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Where feasible and practical, considering the low-risk environment and cost-effectiveness, implement MFA for access to critical systems and data.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign access rights based on user roles and responsibilities. Review and update access privileges regularly to ensure they are still appropriate.
*   **Physical Security:** Restrict physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other sensitive areas. Implement security measures such as locks, alarms, and surveillance cameras.

**5. Incident Response**

Establish a documented incident response plan to address security incidents promptly and effectively. The plan should include:

*   **Incident Identification:** Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents, including data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access.
*   **Incident Containment:** Steps to contain the spread of the incident and prevent further damage.
*   **Incident Eradication:** Measures to remove the cause of the incident and restore affected systems and data.
*   **Incident Recovery:** Procedures for recovering from the incident and returning to normal operations.
*   **Post-Incident Review:** A review of the incident to identify lessons learned and improve security measures.
*   **Reporting:** Procedures for reporting security incidents to relevant authorities, including regulatory agencies and law enforcement, as required by law.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Provide regular security awareness training to all employees, contractors, and third-party partners. The training should cover:

*   **Password Security:** Best practices for creating and managing strong passwords.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** How to identify and avoid phishing attacks.
*   **Malware Awareness:** The risks of malware and how to prevent infection.
*   **Data Protection:** The importance of protecting sensitive data and following data protection policies.
*   **Incident Reporting:** How to report security incidents.
*   **Social Engineering Awareness:** How to recognize and avoid social engineering tactics.

Training should be conducted annually or more frequently if necessary. Attendance and comprehension should be tracked.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

This policy is designed to align with ISO/IEC 27001, adapting the standards to the specific context of a low-risk healthcare environment.

*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if necessary, to ensure it remains current and effective.
*   **Internal Audits:** Conduct periodic internal audits to assess compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement.
*   **External Audits:** Consider periodic external audits by qualified security professionals to provide an independent assessment of the organization's security posture.
*   **Compliance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including HIPAA.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain documentation of all security policies, procedures, and controls.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of [Organization Name]'s commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data. All employees, contractors, and third-party partners are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. By working together, we can maintain a secure environment and protect the sensitive data entrusted to us.
