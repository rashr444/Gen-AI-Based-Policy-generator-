## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security measures required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and organizational assets within our healthcare organization. While we operate in a Low-Risk environment, maintaining a proactive and vigilant security posture is critical. This policy is aligned with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any individuals or entities accessing or using our information systems and data. Adherence to this policy is mandatory and essential for ensuring the continuity of our healthcare services and maintaining patient trust. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

### 2. Risk Assessment

While designated as a Low-Risk environment, we acknowledge the inherent risks associated with handling sensitive patient information. An annual risk assessment will be conducted to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems and data. This assessment will:

-   --Identify Assets:-- Determine all information assets, including patient data, medical records, hardware, software, and network infrastructure.
-   --Identify Threats:-- Identify potential threats to these assets, such as malware, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, and physical security breaches.
-   --Identify Vulnerabilities:-- Identify weaknesses in our systems and processes that could be exploited by these threats.
-   --Analyze Risks:-- Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
-   --Document Findings:-- Maintain detailed documentation of the risk assessment process, findings, and recommendations.
-   --Regular Updates:-- The risk assessment will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur within the organization or threat landscape.

The results of the risk assessment will be used to prioritize security controls and allocate resources effectively. A risk register will be maintained to track identified risks, mitigation strategies, and their implementation status. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for overseeing the risk assessment process and ensuring its effectiveness.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting patient data is our highest priority. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- All sensitive patient data, both in transit and at rest, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only collect and retain data that is necessary for legitimate business purposes. Implement data retention policies to ensure data is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP measures, such as monitoring network traffic and endpoint activity, to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization without authorization.
-   --Secure Storage:-- Store sensitive data in secure, access-controlled locations, both physical and electronic.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regularly back up critical data to a secure, off-site location. Test the backup and recovery process periodically to ensure its effectiveness.
-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on sensitivity and criticality. This classification will guide the implementation of appropriate security controls.
-   --Physical Security:-- Implement physical security measures to protect data centers and other locations where sensitive data is stored.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to patient data and organizational systems will be strictly controlled based on the principle of least privilege:

-   --User Authentication:-- Implement strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for all users accessing sensitive systems and data.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Grant access privileges based on job roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update user access permissions.
-   --Account Management:-- Implement a robust account management process, including procedures for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts.
-   --Password Management:-- Enforce strong password policies, including minimum password length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.
-   --Access Logging and Monitoring:-- Monitor user access activity and investigate any suspicious behavior.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access to our network and systems through VPNs and other secure technologies.
-   --Vendor Access:-- Implement strict access control procedures for vendors and other third parties accessing our systems and data. Conduct regular security assessments of vendors to ensure they meet our security standards.

### 5. Incident Response

A comprehensive incident response plan is essential for effectively managing and mitigating security incidents:

-   --Incident Response Team:-- Establish an incident response team with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
-   --Incident Detection and Reporting:-- Implement systems and processes for detecting and reporting security incidents. All employees are responsible for reporting suspected security incidents immediately.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Implement procedures for containing security incidents to prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Implement procedures for eradicating the root cause of security incidents.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Implement procedures for restoring affected systems and data to normal operations.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned and improve security measures.
-   --Communication Plan:-- Maintain a communication plan for notifying stakeholders, including patients, regulators, and law enforcement, in the event of a security breach.

The Incident Response plan will be reviewed and tested at least annually.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

Security awareness training is crucial for educating employees about security threats and best practices:

-   --Regular Training:-- Provide regular security awareness training to all employees, contractors, and vendors.
-   --Training Content:-- The training will cover topics such as phishing awareness, password security, data protection, incident reporting, and compliance requirements.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Conduct phishing simulations to test employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Training Documentation:-- Maintain documentation of all security awareness training activities.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

-   --Regular Audits:-- Conduct regular internal and external audits to assess compliance with this policy and other relevant security standards.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Conduct regular vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses in our systems and applications.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Conduct periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of our security controls.
-   --Compliance Reporting:-- Generate regular compliance reports to track our progress and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Policy Review:-- This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur within the organization or threat landscape.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of our overall security strategy. By adhering to this policy, we can protect patient data, maintain the integrity of our systems, and ensure the continuity of our healthcare services. The CISO is responsible for the overall implementation and enforcement of this policy. All employees, contractors, and vendors are expected to comply with this policy and contribute to a culture of security awareness and responsibility.
