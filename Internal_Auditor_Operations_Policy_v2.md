Okay, here's a revised cybersecurity policy draft for a low-risk environment in the Operations industry, incorporating the feedback and aligning with NIST, while targeting a diverse audience:

--Cybersecurity Policy--

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of [Company Name]'s information assets. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Company Name]'s systems, data, or networks.  This policy acknowledges that while our operational environment presents a low inherent risk profile, maintaining a robust security posture is crucial for business continuity and compliance.

This policy is designed to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, a widely recognized set of best practices. This framework provides a structure for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity risks.

This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as required by changes in business operations, technology, or regulatory requirements. All stakeholders are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy.

--2. Risk Assessment--

[Company Name] conducts periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information assets.  This process includes:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying critical systems, data, and infrastructure that support business operations.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Determining potential threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.  This includes regular vulnerability scanning using automated tools.
-   --Impact Analysis:-- Assessing the potential impact to the organization if a threat were to exploit a vulnerability.  Impacts considered include financial loss, reputational damage, operational disruption, and legal/regulatory consequences.
-   --Risk Prioritization:--  Ranking identified risks based on their likelihood and potential impact. This prioritization informs the development and implementation of security controls.

The results of the risk assessment inform the development and implementation of security controls and are used to prioritize security investments. The Risk Assessment will be documented and maintained, and it will be updated at least annually or when significant changes occur to the business environment.

--3. Data Protection--

[Company Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data it collects, processes, and stores. This includes:

-   --Data Classification:-- Classifying data based on its sensitivity and criticality.  Examples of classifications might include "Public," "Internal," "Confidential," and "Restricted."
-   --Data Encryption:-- Employing encryption to protect sensitive data at rest (e.g., on hard drives) and in transit (e.g., over the internet).  Strong encryption algorithms will be used.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regularly backing up critical data to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or disaster.  Backup procedures will be tested regularly.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Establishing policies and procedures for the retention and secure disposal of data, in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.
-   --Access Control to Data:-- Limiting access to data based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel will have access to sensitive data.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to [Company Name]'s systems and data will be controlled through a variety of measures:

-   --User Authentication:-- Requiring strong passwords and/or multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts. Passwords must meet complexity requirements (minimum length, character types) and be changed periodically.
-   --Account Management:-- Establishing procedures for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts.  Terminated employees' accounts will be promptly disabled.
-   --Privilege Management:-- Limiting administrative privileges to only those individuals who require them to perform their job duties.  The principle of least privilege will be enforced.
-   --Network Segmentation:--  Logically separating different parts of the network to limit the potential impact of a security breach.  This may involve firewalls and virtual LANs (VLANs).
-   --Physical Security:-- Controlling physical access to company facilities and equipment through measures such as locks, security cameras, and access badges.

--5. Incident Response--

[Company Name] has established an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to address security incidents effectively and efficiently. The IRP outlines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Identifying and classifying security incidents based on their severity and potential impact.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Taking immediate steps to contain the spread of an incident and minimize its impact.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Removing the cause of the incident and restoring affected systems to a secure state.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Recovering data and systems to their normal operating state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Conducting a thorough analysis of the incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Reporting:-- Reporting security incidents to relevant stakeholders, including management, legal counsel, and regulatory authorities, as required.

The Incident Response Plan will be tested regularly through tabletop exercises or simulations.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

[Company Name] provides security awareness training to all employees, contractors, and vendors to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices.  Training topics include:

-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Malware Prevention:-- Understanding how malware spreads and how to prevent infection.
-   --Password Security:-- Creating and managing strong passwords.
-   --Data Protection:-- Protecting sensitive data.
-   --Social Engineering:-- Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
-   --Acceptable Use Policy:-- (See section below)

Training will be conducted at least annually and upon onboarding new personnel. Training effectiveness will be evaluated through quizzes and other methods.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

[Company Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. This includes:

-   --Regular Security Audits:-- Conducting periodic internal or external security audits to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Compliance Monitoring:-- Monitoring compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
-   --Policy Review:-- Reviewing and updating this Cybersecurity Policy at least annually to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
-   --Documentation:-- Maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation of security policies, procedures, and controls.

--8. Acceptable Use Policy--

This section outlines the acceptable use of [Company Name]'s company assets including but not limited to computers, network, and internet.
