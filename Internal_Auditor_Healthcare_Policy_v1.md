## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, acknowledging that while inherent risks exist, the organization has implemented reasonable and appropriate safeguards to mitigate those risks. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals with access to [Organization Name]'s systems and data are expected to adhere to this policy. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as required by changes in regulations, technology, or business operations. This policy is aligned with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule and other applicable regulations.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] conducts periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. These risk assessments will:

-   --Identify Assets:-- Determine the scope of data and information systems requiring protection, including but not limited to electronic PHI (ePHI), patient records, financial information, and other sensitive data.
-   --Identify Threats:-- Identify potential threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these assets, including but not limited to malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, insider threats, and physical security breaches.
-   --Identify Vulnerabilities:-- Identify weaknesses in systems, applications, or processes that could be exploited by identified threats.
-   --Analyze and Evaluate Risks:-- Assess the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks, taking into account the sensitivity of the data and the potential harm to patients, the organization, and its stakeholders.
-   --Document Findings:-- Risk assessment findings will be formally documented and used to prioritize security improvements and resource allocation.
-   --Frequency:-- Risk assessments will be conducted at least annually and whenever there are significant changes to the organization's IT infrastructure, business operations, or regulatory environment.
-   --Low Risk Environment Context:-- Given the low-risk environment, risk assessments will focus on readily available and cost-effective security measures to address the most common and impactful threats.

### 3. Data Protection

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, including PHI.

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality to the organization. PHI and other sensitive data will be treated with the highest level of protection.
-   --Data Encryption:-- ePHI stored on portable devices (laptops, tablets, USB drives) must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms. Data at rest on servers will also be encrypted where feasible and deemed necessary by the risk assessment.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data, including ePHI, will be performed and stored securely offsite. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.
-   --Data Disposal:-- All data, including ePHI, must be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed. Electronic media must be securely wiped or physically destroyed. Paper records must be shredded.
-   --Data Transmission:-- ePHI transmitted electronically will be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP, VPN). Email communications containing sensitive information should be avoided whenever possible; when necessary, the email should be encrypted or sent using secure messaging services.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to information systems and data will be restricted to authorized personnel only, based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- All users must authenticate themselves using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available and feasible.
-   --Password Management:-- Passwords must meet complexity requirements (minimum length, use of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) and be changed regularly. Password reuse is prohibited.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Access to specific systems and data will be granted based on job responsibilities and a formal access request process.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and disabled based on employee onboarding, role changes, and terminations. Dormant accounts will be regularly reviewed and disabled.
-   --Physical Access:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel through the use of access control systems (e.g., key cards, biometrics). Visitors will be required to sign in and be escorted.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network will be secured through the use of VPNs and MFA, where feasible. Remote access policies will define acceptable use and security requirements for remote connections.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] will maintain a documented incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All suspected security incidents must be reported immediately to the IT department or designated security personnel.
-   --Incident Identification and Analysis:-- Security incidents will be promptly investigated to determine the scope and impact of the incident.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Measures will be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Malicious software or other causes of the incident will be removed from the affected systems.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Systems and data will be restored to normal operation as quickly as possible.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- A post-incident review will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and implement measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
-   --Breach Notification:-- In the event of a data breach involving unsecured PHI, [Organization Name] will comply with all applicable breach notification requirements under HIPAA and other relevant regulations.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training on a regular basis to educate them about cybersecurity risks and their responsibilities in protecting the organization's data.

-   --Training Topics:-- Training will cover topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, incident reporting, and compliance with HIPAA regulations.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training will be provided to all new employees upon hire and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training may be delivered through online modules, in-person sessions, or other appropriate methods.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Periodic phishing simulations may be conducted to test employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] will maintain a program to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA and other applicable cybersecurity regulations.

-   --Policy Enforcement:-- This Cybersecurity Policy will be consistently enforced across the organization.
-   --Regular Audits:-- Internal audits will be conducted periodically to assess compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans of IT infrastructure will be performed to identify potential security weaknesses. Penetration testing will be considered based on risk assessments and the overall threat landscape.
-   --Security Patch Management:-- Security patches will be applied to systems and applications in a timely manner to address known vulnerabilities.
-   --Business Associate Agreements:-- All business associates who have access to ePHI will be required to sign business associate agreements (BAAs) that outline their responsibilities for protecting the data.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy demonstrates [Organization Name]'s commitment to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data in a low risk environment. By adhering to the principles and guidelines outlined in this policy, we can minimize the risk of security incidents and ensure the privacy and security of patient information. All employees, contractors, and vendors are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.
