## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Finance Environment

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Review Date:** [Date - Typically 1 year from Effective Date]
**Policy Owner:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security requirements and best practices for [Company Name] to protect its information assets, comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data. This policy is specifically tailored for a low-risk environment within the finance industry and considers the sensitivity of information handled. While the risk is deemed low, adherence to this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, vendors, and other authorized users who access, process, or store company information. This policy is aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable financial industry regulations.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Company Name] recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. Given the classification of this environment as low-risk, the following simplified risk assessment approach is adopted:

*   **Asset Inventory:** A regularly updated inventory of all IT assets (hardware, software, and data) within this environment will be maintained, including their location, purpose, and owner.
*   **Threat Identification:** Common threats applicable to low-risk environments, such as phishing attacks, malware infections via removable media, and weak password practices, will be considered.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Periodic vulnerability scans will be conducted to identify known vulnerabilities in systems and applications. These scans will be performed at least [Frequency - e.g., quarterly].
*   **Impact Assessment:** The potential impact of identified risks will be assessed based on factors like data sensitivity, operational disruption, and reputational damage. Due to the low-risk classification, impact levels are expected to be relatively low.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Based on the risk assessment, appropriate mitigation measures will be implemented, focusing on cost-effective controls and adherence to this policy.

**3. Data Protection**

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. This section outlines data protection measures aligned with GDPR principles:

*   **Data Minimization:** [Company Name] will collect and process only the personal data necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Personal data will be processed only for the purposes for which it was collected, unless otherwise permitted by law or with explicit consent.
*   **Data Accuracy:** Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that personal data is accurate and kept up to date. Inaccurate or incomplete data will be rectified or erased without delay.
*   **Storage Limitation:** Personal data will be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. Data retention schedules will be established and adhered to.
*   **Data Security:** Appropriate technical and organizational measures will be implemented to protect personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. This includes:
    *   **Encryption:** Sensitive data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    *   **Data Backup:** Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, following the 3-2-1 backup rule (three copies of data on two different media, with one copy offsite).
    *   **Data Masking/Pseudonymization:** Where appropriate, data masking or pseudonymization techniques will be used to protect sensitive data.
*   **Data Subject Rights:** [Company Name] will respect the rights of data subjects under GDPR, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, and data portability. Procedures will be in place to handle data subject requests promptly and effectively.
*   **Data Breach Notification:** In the event of a data breach, [Company Name] will comply with GDPR requirements for notification to the relevant supervisory authority and affected data subjects.

**4. Access Controls**

Limiting access to sensitive information is crucial for data protection:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users will be granted access only to the information and systems necessary to perform their job duties.
*   **Password Management:** Strong and unique passwords will be required for all user accounts.
    *   Minimum password length: [Number - e.g., 12 characters]
    *   Password complexity requirements: [Specify - e.g., include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters]
    *   Password change frequency: [Frequency - e.g., Every 90 days]
    *   Prohibited password practices: Reuse of passwords across multiple accounts, use of easily guessable passwords (e.g., dictionary words, personal information).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA will be enabled for all critical systems and applications, especially those containing sensitive data.
*   **Access Reviews:** User access rights will be reviewed periodically (e.g., quarterly) to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with job roles.
*   **Account Lockout:** Account lockout policies will be implemented to prevent brute-force password attacks.
*   **Remote Access:** Remote access to the network will be secured through the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with strong authentication.

**5. Incident Response**

A well-defined incident response plan is essential to minimize the impact of security incidents:

*   **Incident Definition:** A security incident is defined as any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information assets.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Employees are required to report any suspected security incidents immediately to [Designated Contact/Team - e.g., IT Helpdesk, Security Team].
*   **Incident Response Procedures:** A documented incident response plan will be maintained and regularly tested. The plan will outline the steps to be taken to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
*   **Post-Incident Analysis:** Following a security incident, a post-incident analysis will be conducted to determine the root cause, identify lessons learned, and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Raising employee awareness of cybersecurity risks is vital for a strong security posture:

*   **Training Content:** Security awareness training will cover topics such as:
    *   Phishing awareness and prevention
    *   Password security best practices
    *   Data handling and protection procedures
    *   Incident reporting procedures
    *   Social engineering tactics
    *   Malware awareness
*   **Training Frequency:** Security awareness training will be provided to all employees upon hire and annually thereafter.
*   **Training Delivery:** Training may be delivered through various methods, such as online modules, classroom sessions, or simulated phishing exercises.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a key responsibility:

*   **Policy Adherence:** All employees, contractors, vendors, and other authorized users are required to comply with this Cybersecurity Policy.
*   **Internal Audits:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and identify areas for improvement.
*   **External Audits:** [Company Name] may be subject to external audits by regulatory bodies or other third parties to verify compliance with applicable regulations.
*   **Policy Review:** This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.
*   **GDPR Compliance:** Specific audits will be carried out to prove GDPR compliance (Data Protection Impact Assessment).

**8. Conclusion**
