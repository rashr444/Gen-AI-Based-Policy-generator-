## Cybersecurity Policy for Operations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the standards and procedures that [Company Name] implements to protect its information assets in a low-risk operational environment. This policy is designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company data while adhering to industry best practices and meeting applicable compliance requirements, particularly the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other parties accessing or using [Company Name]'s information systems and data. This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address evolving threats and business requirements.

--2. Risk Assessment--

Given the low-risk nature of our operations environment, we will conduct a simplified risk assessment at least annually. This assessment will focus on identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities relevant to our specific business processes. Key areas of focus include:

-   --Data Storage:-- Assessing the security of data storage locations (e.g., file servers, cloud storage) and backup mechanisms.
-   --Network Security:-- Evaluating the security of our network infrastructure, including firewalls and access points.
-   --Endpoint Security:-- Ensuring the security of devices used by employees, such as computers and mobile devices.
-   --Physical Security:-- Evaluating the physical security of our facilities and equipment.
-   --Third-Party Risk:-- Assessing the security practices of vendors and service providers who access or process our data.

The risk assessment will consider the likelihood and impact of potential security incidents, allowing us to prioritize security controls and resources. We will use a qualitative approach to risk assessment, categorizing risks as low, medium, or high based on their potential impact on business operations. Mitigation strategies will be developed for all identified risks, with priority given to addressing high-risk vulnerabilities. The results of the risk assessment will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.

--3. Data Protection--

[Company Name] recognizes the importance of protecting sensitive data. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Classification:-- All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Public data, internal data, confidential data, and restricted data. Guidelines on handling each type of data will be clearly defined.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption will be used to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit. This includes encrypting hard drives, using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS), and encrypting data stored in the cloud. Data covered by legal or regulatory requirements will be encrypted as necessary to comply with all applicable laws.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, in a location separate from the production environment. Backup and recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness. Backup frequency will be determined by data criticality.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet business and legal requirements. Data disposal will be performed securely, using methods that prevent unauthorized access to the data.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to information systems and data will be controlled based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the access necessary to perform their job duties. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Account Management:-- User accounts will be created and managed centrally. Account creation will follow a defined process, and accounts will be promptly disabled or terminated when employees leave the company or change roles.
-   --Password Policy:-- A strong password policy will be enforced, requiring users to create complex passwords and change them regularly. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented where feasible, especially for privileged accounts and remote access.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access to systems and data will be granted based on user roles and responsibilities. This will ensure that users have only the access they need to perform their jobs.
-   --Remote Access Security:-- Remote access to company systems will be secured using VPNs, multi-factor authentication, and other appropriate security measures. All remote access activities will be monitored for suspicious behavior.
-   --Physical Access Controls:-- Physical access to company facilities and server rooms will be restricted to authorized personnel. Access control systems, such as keycards or biometric scanners, will be used to control physical access.

--5. Incident Response--

[Company Name] will establish an incident response plan to effectively manage and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The incident response plan will include the following elements:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents, including suspicious activity and potential breaches.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Steps to contain the impact of a security incident, such as isolating affected systems and preventing further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Procedures for removing the cause of a security incident, such as patching vulnerabilities or removing malware.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Steps to restore affected systems and data to a normal state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A review of each security incident to identify lessons learned and improve security measures.
-   --Reporting:-- Incident reporting procedures and escalation paths, including notification to relevant stakeholders and authorities, as required by law.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees will receive security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices. The training will cover topics such as:

-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Recognizing and avoiding phishing scams.
-   --Password Security:-- Creating and managing strong passwords.
-   --Data Protection:-- Handling sensitive data securely.
-   --Social Engineering:-- Identifying and avoiding social engineering attacks.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Reporting suspicious activity and security incidents.
-   --Acceptable Use Policy:-- Understanding and adhering to company policies regarding the use of information systems.

Training will be provided upon hire and annually thereafter. Refresher training will be provided as needed to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

[Company Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. The following compliance and auditing measures will be implemented:

-   --Regular Security Audits:-- Periodic internal security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans will be performed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Periodic penetration testing will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in our security posture.
-   --Compliance Monitoring:-- Ongoing monitoring of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.
-   --Policy Review:-- This cybersecurity policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address evolving threats and business requirements.
-   --Documentation:-- Maintain documentation of all security policies, procedures, and controls.
-   --NIST Alignment:-- Mapping controls to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to ensure alignment with industry best practices and to provide a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management. Particular attention will be paid to the 'Identify', 'Protect', 'Detect', 'Respond', and 'Recover' functions.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting [Company Name]'s information assets in a low-risk operations environment. By adhering to the principles and procedures outlined in this policy, we can minimize the risk of security incidents and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. All employees are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
