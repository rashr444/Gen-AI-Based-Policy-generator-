## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security measures implemented to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or utilizing our systems and data. This policy is tailored for a low-risk environment, acknowledging the limited scope of our operations and data sensitivity, while maintaining compliance with applicable regulations, particularly the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

--2. Risk Assessment--

A fundamental aspect of our security program is the regular assessment of potential risks to our data and systems. Given our classification as a low-risk environment, risk assessments will be conducted annually and whenever significant changes occur to our infrastructure, applications, or business processes. These assessments will identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the likelihood and impact of security incidents. Remediation efforts will be prioritized based on the identified risk level, focusing on readily available and cost-effective measures. Risk assessment will be based on:
    -   --Asset Inventory:-- Identifying and categorizing all hardware, software, and data assets.
    -   --Threat Identification:-- Determining potential threats such as malware, phishing, and unauthorized access.
    -   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Evaluating weaknesses in systems and processes.
    -   --Impact Analysis:-- Assessing the potential impact of a security breach on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting PHI and other sensitive data is paramount. The following measures are implemented:

-   --Data Minimization:-- We collect and retain only the minimum necessary information required for legitimate business purposes.
-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI stored at rest on company-owned devices will be encrypted, where technically feasible and cost-effective, using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data transmitted externally will be encrypted using secure protocols such as HTTPS.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, ensuring data recovery in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backup frequency will be determined based on data criticality and recovery time objectives.
-   --Data Disposal:-- When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using methods that prevent unauthorized access or retrieval. Physical media will be shredded or degaussed, and electronic data will be securely wiped.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to PHI and sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege. This means individuals are granted only the access necessary to perform their job duties.

-   --User Authentication:-- All users are required to authenticate with strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA), where feasible, to access systems and applications. Password policies will be enforced, requiring regular password changes and complexity.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Access to data and systems is granted based on roles and responsibilities. Access requests are reviewed and approved by designated personnel.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:-- User access rights are reviewed periodically (at least annually) to ensure they remain appropriate and necessary. Terminated employees' access is promptly revoked.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to facilities and data centers is restricted through measures such as locked doors, visitor management systems, and surveillance cameras.

--5. Incident Response--

A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for effectively addressing security incidents and minimizing their impact.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All suspected security incidents, regardless of their severity, must be reported immediately to the designated security contact or IT department.
-   --Incident Handling:-- Incidents will be investigated and addressed according to the incident response plan, which includes steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
-   --Breach Notification:-- In the event of a breach involving PHI, notification procedures will be followed in accordance with HIPAA regulations and applicable state laws.
-   --Documentation:-- All security incidents and their resolution are documented for future reference and continuous improvement.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

Security awareness training is provided to all employees to educate them about security threats, best practices, and their responsibilities in protecting data.

-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training is conducted upon hire and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Content:-- Training covers topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data privacy, and incident reporting.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training is delivered through a combination of online modules, presentations, and interactive sessions.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Periodic phishing simulations may be conducted to assess employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

This cybersecurity policy is designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA.

-   --Regular Audits:-- Periodic security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify areas for improvement.
-   --Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever significant changes occur to our business operations or regulatory landscape.
-   --Documentation:-- All security policies, procedures, and controls are documented and readily available for review.
-   --Business Associate Agreements (BAA):-- Agreements are in place with all Business Associates who access or process PHI, ensuring they meet HIPAA requirements.

--8. Conclusion--

Maintaining a strong security posture is essential for protecting sensitive data, preserving patient trust, and ensuring the continuity of our operations. This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for managing security risks in our low-risk environment. All employees are expected to adhere to this policy and contribute to a culture of security awareness. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
