Okay, here's a revised version of the Cybersecurity Policy, incorporating the feedback you provided. I've focused on adding specifics, improving the Incident Response section, adding a Physical Security and Environmental Controls section, and most importantly, attempting to demonstrate DDRO compliance (although, without knowing what DDRO is, I've made educated guesses and included placeholders).  Remember to replace the bracketed DDRO references with -actual- DDRO requirements.  This is crucial for true compliance.

--Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare (Low Risk Environment)--

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the requirements and guidelines for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using our information systems and data. This policy is designed to address the unique security needs of a low-risk healthcare environment while adhering to the requirements stipulated under DDRO compliance standards, specifically [DDRO Section 3.2 - Data Protection Requirements] and [DDRO Section 4.1 - Access Control Standards].  This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed to address emerging threats and changes in regulations. The Policy owner is the [Designated Security Officer or Role].

--2. Risk Assessment--

A formal risk assessment will be conducted at least annually, and after any significant change to IT infrastructure or business processes, to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems and data. This fulfills the requirements of [DDRO Section 2.1 - Annual Risk Assessment]. The scope of the risk assessment will include:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identification of all physical and logical assets, including hardware (servers, workstations, mobile devices), software (operating systems, applications, databases), data (patient records, financial information), facilities (data centers, offices), and cloud services.  The asset inventory will be maintained in [Specific location, e.g., the IT Asset Management System] and reviewed quarterly.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identification of potential threats, such as malware (ransomware, viruses, worms), phishing attacks (spear phishing, whaling), insider threats (intentional or unintentional), natural disasters (floods, fires, earthquakes), and denial-of-service attacks.  Threat intelligence feeds from [Name of Threat Intelligence Provider] will be used to inform threat identification.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Assessment of existing vulnerabilities in our systems and processes, including unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigured systems, and lack of security awareness training. Vulnerability scans will be performed using [Name of Vulnerability Scanner] on a [Frequency, e.g., monthly] basis.
-   --Risk Analysis:-- Analysis of the likelihood and impact of each identified threat and vulnerability. Likelihood will be assessed based on factors such as the prevalence of the threat, the effectiveness of existing controls, and the attractiveness of the target. Impact will be assessed based on factors such as the potential for data breach, financial loss, reputational damage, and disruption of operations.
-   --Risk Evaluation:-- Evaluation of the overall risk level for each asset and the organization as a whole, using a defined risk matrix (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
-   --Risk Treatment:-- Implementing appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks based on a risk-based approach. This may include implementing technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems), administrative controls (e.g., security policies, training), and physical controls (e.g., access control, surveillance). All risk treatment decisions will be documented in the Risk Register.

Due to the "Low Risk" categorization, we will prioritize addressing critical and high-risk vulnerabilities first, but this does not mean that other vulnerability classes will be ignored. Regular scanning and vulnerability assessment will be performed to identify and categorize risks. All identified vulnerabilities will be tracked in [Vulnerability Management System Name] and remediated within [Specific Timeframe based on risk level - e.g., Critical within 7 days, High within 30 days, Medium within 90 days, Low within 180 days].

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. The following data protection measures will be implemented, aligning with [DDRO Section 3.3 - Data Security Safeguards]:

-   --Data Minimization:-- Limiting the collection, use, and retention of PHI and other sensitive data to only what is necessary for legitimate business purposes.  Data retention policies will be reviewed and updated annually, as per [DDRO Section 3.3.1 - Data Retention Policy Requirements].  Data retention schedules are documented in [Location of Data Retention Schedule].
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encrypting sensitive data at rest (e.g., using full-disk encryption on laptops and servers, encrypting databases) and in transit (e.g., using TLS for web traffic, encrypting email communications) using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2 or higher).  Encryption keys will be managed securely using [Key Management System or Process].  This adheres to [DDRO Section 3.3.2 - Encryption Standards].
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regularly backing up data to secure, offsite locations (e.g., using cloud-based backup services or tape backups stored in a secure vault), and testing the recovery process at least quarterly to ensure data can be restored within acceptable recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).  Backup schedules and recovery procedures are documented in the Disaster Recovery Plan.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implementing DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This may include monitoring network traffic, email communications, and file transfers for sensitive data patterns (e.g., using DLP software or email filtering rules).  Any DLP incidents will be investigated and reported to the [Privacy Officer/Security Officer].
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Establishing a data retention schedule and securely disposing of data that is no longer needed in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). Data disposal methods will include securely wiping hard drives, shredding paper documents, and destroying electronic media.
-   --Physical Security:-- Securely storing physical records containing PHI in locked cabinets or rooms with limited access. Access to these areas will be logged and monitored. This adheres to [DDRO physical security requirements - specify section if applicable].

--4. Access Controls--

Access to information systems and data will be restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege, in accordance with [DDRO Section 4.2 - Least Privilege Access]. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- Requiring strong passwords (at least 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing sensitive systems and data. Password complexity requirements will be enforced through group policy. MFA will be enforced using [MFA Solution].
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Assigning access rights based on job roles and responsibilities. Access roles will be defined and documented, and users will be assigned to roles based on their job functions.  RBAC mappings will be reviewed quarterly.
-   --Access Review:-- Conducting regular access reviews (at least quarterly) to ensure that users only have the access they need. Access reviews will be documented and signed off by the relevant department heads.
-   --Privileged Access Management (PAM):-- Implementing PAM controls to manage and monitor privileged accounts. This may include using a password vault to store and manage privileged credentials, and monitoring privileged account activity.  PAM will be implemented using [PAM Solution].
-   --Account Management:-- Establishing procedures for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts in a timely manner. User accounts will be created within [Timeframe - e.g., 24 hours] of onboarding, modified when job roles change, and disabled within [Timeframe - e.g., 24 hours] of termination.
