## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and organizational assets within our healthcare environment. This policy is designed to align with industry best practices, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and reflect our commitment to maintaining a low-risk security posture. All employees, contractors, and other authorized users are required to adhere to this policy. This policy serves to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the continuity of critical healthcare operations, fostering trust with our patients and partners.

--2. Risk Assessment--

We conduct regular risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities to our systems and data. Given our low-risk environment, these assessments are streamlined, focusing on common healthcare threats such as phishing, malware, and unauthorized access to patient records. Assessments will encompass:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Inventory of all hardware, software, and data assets.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identification of potential threats, including malware, ransomware, social engineering, and insider threats.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Evaluation of existing vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Ranking risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
-   --Mitigation Planning:-- Development of plans to mitigate identified risks, including implementation of security controls and procedures.
The risk assessment process will be reviewed and updated annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in our environment.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting patient data is paramount. This policy mandates the following data protection measures:

-   --Data Minimization:-- Collection and retention of only necessary patient information.
-   --Encryption:-- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit, using industry-standard encryption protocols. This includes encrypting hard drives, databases, and network communications.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data to secure offsite locations with tested recovery procedures. Backups shall be retained in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Secure disposal of electronic and physical media containing sensitive data, using approved sanitization methods.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implementation of basic DLP measures, such as monitoring for sensitive data leaving the network and educating employees on data handling procedures.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users will only be granted the minimum access necessary to perform their job duties. Specific access control measures include:

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong password policies, including complexity requirements, regular password changes, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Assignment of user roles with predefined access permissions.
-   --Access Revocation:-- Prompt revocation of access privileges for terminated employees or those who change roles.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:-- Periodic review of user access privileges to ensure they remain appropriate.
-   --Physical Security:-- Secure access to physical facilities and data centers, including access badges and visitor logs.

--5. Incident Response--

A well-defined Incident Response Plan (IRP) is essential for handling security incidents effectively. The IRP outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach, including:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Containment:-- Actions to isolate and contain the incident to prevent further damage.
-   --Eradication:-- Removal of the cause of the incident.
-   --Recovery:-- Restoration of systems and data to a normal state.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- Documentation of the incident, analysis of root causes, and implementation of corrective actions.
The IRP will be tested regularly through tabletop exercises or simulations. All employees will be trained on their roles and responsibilities in the IRP.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

Regular security awareness training is essential to educate employees about cybersecurity threats and best practices. Training will cover:

-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Malware Prevention:-- Understanding how malware spreads and how to prevent infection.
-   --Password Security:-- Creating and maintaining strong passwords.
-   --Data Handling:-- Protecting sensitive data and complying with data protection policies.
-   --Social Engineering:-- Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
Training will be conducted at least annually and will be tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of employees.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. We will conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with this policy and other relevant security requirements. Audits will include:

-   --Internal Audits:-- Periodic reviews of security controls and procedures.
-   --External Audits:-- Independent assessments of our security posture by qualified third parties.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular scans to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Simulated attacks to identify weaknesses in our security defenses.
Audit findings will be reported to senior management and will be used to improve our security posture.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is a living document that will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the threat landscape, technology, and business requirements. By adhering to this policy, we can collectively protect patient data, maintain the integrity of our systems, and ensure the continuity of critical healthcare operations. All employees are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy.
