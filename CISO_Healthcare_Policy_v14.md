--1. Introduction--

--1.1 Purpose:--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security standards and guidelines that [Organization Name] (hereinafter referred to as "the Organization") will adhere to in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive information. This policy aims to mitigate cybersecurity risks, comply with applicable laws and regulations (including HIPAA and relevant state privacy laws), and maintain the trust of our patients, partners, and employees. This policy is designed to align with the best practices outlined in ISO/IEC 27001.

--1.2 Scope:--

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, students, and any other individuals or entities (hereinafter referred to as "Users") who access, use, or manage the Organization's information systems, networks, data, and physical facilities. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   All data, whether stored electronically or physically.
-   All software applications used by the Organization.
-   All physical locations where the Organization's information assets are stored or processed.

--1.3 Policy Statement:--

The Organization is committed to maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture and protecting its information assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. We believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and all Users are expected to comply with this policy and related procedures.

--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Purpose:--

To identify, assess, and prioritize cybersecurity risks to the Organization's information assets. This process ensures that security controls are implemented effectively to mitigate the most critical threats.

--2.2 Process:--

A risk assessment will be conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur] by [Designated Role/Team - e.g., the IT Security Team, a designated third party].  The risk assessment will include the following steps:

-   --Asset Identification:--  Identifying all critical information assets, including hardware, software, data, and physical locations.
-   --Threat Identification:--  Identifying potential threats to the Organization's information assets, such as malware, phishing, ransomware, data breaches, and insider threats.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, or processes that could be exploited by threats.
-   --Impact Analysis:--  Determining the potential impact to the Organization if a threat were to successfully exploit a vulnerability.  This includes considering financial, legal, reputational, and operational impacts.
-   --Likelihood Assessment:--  Determining the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
-   --Risk Prioritization:--  Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. Risks will be categorized as High, Medium, or Low.
-   --Risk Treatment:--  Developing and implementing strategies to mitigate identified risks. Risk treatment options include:
    -   --Risk Avoidance:-- Eliminating the risk by discontinuing the activity that creates the risk. (Likely not possible in most cases).
    -   --Risk Mitigation:-- Implementing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
    -   --Risk Transfer:-- Transferring the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance).
    -   --Risk Acceptance:--  Accepting the risk if the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential benefits. (Requires documented justification and approval).

--2.3 Documentation:--

The risk assessment process and its findings will be documented in a Risk Register, which will be maintained and updated regularly.

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Purpose:--

To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI and other sensitive data.

--3.2 Data Classification:--

All data will be classified according to its sensitivity and criticality.  The following data classifications will be used:

-   --Confidential:--  Data that requires the highest level of protection due to legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements. This includes PHI, financial data, and employee records.  Unauthorized disclosure could cause significant harm to the Organization.
-   --Internal Use Only:-- Data intended for internal use only and not for public distribution.
-   --Public:-- Data that is publicly available and does not require special protection.

--3.3 Data Handling Procedures:--

-   --Storage:-- Confidential data must be stored securely, using encryption where appropriate, both in transit and at rest.
-   --Transmission:-- Confidential data must be transmitted securely, using encryption and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP).
-   --Access:-- Access to confidential data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.  Users will only be granted access to the data they need to perform their job duties.
-   --Disposal:--  Confidential data must be disposed of securely, using methods that prevent unauthorized access or recovery (e.g., shredding, data wiping).
-   --Backups:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, following the 3-2-1 rule: three copies, on two different media, with one offsite. Backup data will be tested regularly to ensure recoverability.

--3.4 Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--

The Organization will implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Organization's control without authorization.  This may include monitoring network traffic, email, and removable media.

--4. Access Controls--

--4.1 Purpose:--

--Important Considerations and Customization Points:--

-   --Specific Technologies:--  This policy doesn't name specific technologies (antivirus software, firewalls, etc.) to avoid obsolescence. Document those separately in supporting procedures.
-   --Low-Risk Definition:-- This is a "low risk" policy. Define what constitutes low risk in -your- context. What services are you providing? What type of data are you processing? Low-risk does not mean "no risk".
-   --Budget and Resources:-- A low-risk environment will likely have limited resources. Prioritize controls based on their cost-effectiveness and impact.
-   --Cloud Services:-- If you're using cloud services, clearly outline responsibilities between you and the cloud provider (security of the cloud vs. security -in- the cloud).
-   --Mobile Devices:-- Address the use of personal mobile devices for work purposes (BYOD) if applicable.
-   --Third-Party Risk Management:-- Even in a low-risk environment, you likely have vendors. Outline a process for assessing the security posture of third parties who access your data.
-   --Physical Security:-- Don't forget physical security aspects like access controls to facilities, server rooms, and data storage areas.
-   --Enforcement:-- How will you enforce this policy? (e.g., through automated monitoring, manual reviews, disciplinary action).
-   --Exceptions:-- Establish a process for requesting and approving exceptions to the policy. Document all exceptions and their justifications.
-   --Regular Review:--  This policy must be a living document. Regular review, updates, and ongoing assessment are crucial.
-   --Legal Review:--  This document -must- be reviewed by legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
-   --Training Records:-- Keep records of all cybersecurity training provided to employees. This is vital for demonstrating compliance.

By customizing this template with your specific organizational details and implementing the outlined controls, you can establish a solid foundation for cybersecurity in your low-risk healthcare environment.  Remember, this is a starting point and requires careful attention to detail and ongoing maintenance. Good luck!
