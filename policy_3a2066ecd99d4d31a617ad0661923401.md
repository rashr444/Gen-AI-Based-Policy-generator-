## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

**Policy Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Review Date:** [Date - One Year from Effective Date]
**Approved By:** [Name and Title]

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within [Organization Name], a low-risk healthcare environment. This policy is designed to be practical and achievable, considering the organization's limited resources and risk profile. It aligns with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, volunteers, and any other individuals granted access to [Organization Name]'s systems and data. This policy aims to establish a security-conscious culture, minimize the risk of data breaches, and ensure the continued provision of quality healthcare services.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Organization Name] recognizes the importance of identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks. Due to our low-risk environment, a simplified risk assessment will be conducted annually, focusing on the following:

*   **Scope:** This assessment will cover all systems, applications, and data used by [Organization Name], including electronic health records (EHRs), patient information, and administrative data.
*   **Threat Identification:** Identification of common threats relevant to healthcare organizations, such as phishing attacks, malware infections, ransomware, and unauthorized access to systems.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Assessment of existing vulnerabilities in systems and applications, including outdated software, weak passwords, and inadequate access controls.
*   **Impact Analysis:** Evaluation of the potential impact of a security incident on patient care, reputation, and compliance obligations.
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Risks will be prioritized based on their likelihood and potential impact, with higher-priority risks addressed first.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and used to inform the implementation of security controls outlined in this policy. Mitigation strategies will be prioritized based on available resources and the potential impact of identified risks. Documentation will be retained for auditing purposes.

**3. Data Protection**

This section addresses the protection of personal data, particularly PHI, as required by GDPR and other applicable regulations.

*   **Data Minimization:** [Organization Name] will only collect, process, and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary for legitimate business purposes and patient care.
*   **Data Accuracy:** Procedures will be implemented to ensure the accuracy and completeness of personal data. Regular reviews and updates of patient information will be conducted.
*   **Data Retention:** Personal data will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. A data retention schedule will be maintained.
*   **Data Disposal:** When personal data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of in a manner that prevents unauthorized access or disclosure (e.g., secure deletion, shredding).
*   **Data Encryption:**  Encryption will be used to protect sensitive data both in transit (e.g., via HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., using whole-disk encryption on laptops).
*   **GDPR Compliance:** [Organization Name] recognizes and respects the rights of data subjects under GDPR, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, object to processing, and data portability. Procedures are in place to respond to data subject requests in a timely and compliant manner. Consent will be obtained for processing personal data where required.

**4. Access Controls**

Access controls are implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and systems.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users will be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.
*   **User Account Management:**  All users will have unique accounts and passwords. Default passwords will be changed immediately upon account creation.
*   **Password Policy:** A strong password policy will be enforced, requiring users to create complex passwords that are regularly changed (at least every 90 days). Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA will be implemented where feasible, especially for accessing critical systems and data.
*   **Account Review:** User accounts will be reviewed regularly (at least annually) to ensure that access privileges are still appropriate. Dormant accounts will be disabled or deleted.
*   **Physical Security:** Physical access to servers and other critical infrastructure will be restricted to authorized personnel only.
*   **Remote Access:** Remote access to the network will be secured using VPN or other secure protocols.

**5. Incident Response**

A documented incident response plan will be in place to address security incidents effectively and minimize their impact.

*   **Incident Reporting:** All suspected security incidents, including data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access attempts, must be reported immediately to [Designated Contact/Team - e.g., IT Help Desk].
*   **Incident Classification:** Reported incidents will be classified based on their severity and potential impact.
*   **Incident Containment:**  Measures will be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
*   **Incident Eradication:**  The root cause of the incident will be identified and eliminated.
*   **Incident Recovery:** Systems and data will be restored to normal operation.
*   **Post-Incident Analysis:** A post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
*   **Data Breach Notification:**  In the event of a data breach involving PHI or other personal data, [Organization Name] will comply with all applicable notification requirements under GDPR and other relevant regulations.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training will be provided to all employees, contractors, and volunteers to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices.

*   **Training Content:** Training will cover topics such as:
    *   Phishing awareness
    *   Malware prevention
    *   Password security
    *   Data protection principles
    *   Incident reporting procedures
    *   Social engineering
*   **Training Frequency:** Security awareness training will be provided upon onboarding and at least annually thereafter.
*   **Training Delivery:** Training can be delivered through a variety of methods, including online modules, in-person presentations, and awareness campaigns.
*   **Training Records:** Records of training completion will be maintained.
