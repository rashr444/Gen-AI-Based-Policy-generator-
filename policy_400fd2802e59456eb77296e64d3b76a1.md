**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy ("Policy") outlines the security measures required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within [Name of Financial Institution], operating in a low-risk environment. This Policy is designed to establish a foundational level of cybersecurity hygiene, mitigating common threats and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While this policy focuses on a low-risk profile, it is understood that cybersecurity threats are evolving, and this policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to changes in the threat landscape.

This Policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other third parties who access or use [Name of Financial Institution]'s information assets, regardless of location or device. Non-compliance with this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

**2. Risk Assessment**

Given the low-risk environment, risk assessments will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the business, technology, or regulatory landscape. The risk assessment process will:

*   **Identify Assets:** Identify and categorize information assets, including customer data, financial records, and internal systems.
*   **Identify Threats:** Identify potential threats to information assets, such as phishing attacks, malware infections, and unauthorized access.
*   **Assess Vulnerabilities:** Identify vulnerabilities in systems and processes that could be exploited by threats.
*   **Analyze Impact:** Evaluate the potential impact of security incidents on business operations, financial stability, and regulatory compliance.
*   **Determine Risk Levels:** Assign risk levels (low, medium, high) based on the likelihood and impact of potential incidents.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Develop and implement appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks to acceptable levels. Mitigation strategies may include procedural controls, technical controls, and insurance.
*   **Documentation:** Document the risk assessment process, findings, and mitigation strategies.

**3. Data Protection (GDPR Compliance)**

Protecting personal data is paramount. This section outlines requirements for handling personal data in compliance with GDPR principles:

*   **Data Minimization:** Collect and process only the personal data that is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

*   **Data Security:** Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Regular backups of data and systems.
    *   Access controls to restrict access to personal data to authorized personnel.
*   **Data Breach Notification:** Establish procedures for detecting, reporting, and investigating data breaches. Notify the relevant supervisory authority and affected data subjects as required by GDPR.

*   **Third-Party Data Processing:** Ensure that any third-party data processors comply with GDPR requirements.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to information assets will be controlled based on the principle of least privilege:

*   **User Authentication:** Implement strong authentication methods, such as strong passwords (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements), multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems.
*   **Authorization:** Grant access to information assets only to authorized personnel based on their job responsibilities.
