Okay, let's build a Cybersecurity Policy tailored to the financial industry, specifically addressing a "Low" risk scenario while adhering to PCI DSS standards.

**Step 1: Identifying Common Threats and Vulnerabilities in Finance**

The Finance sector is a prime target for cyberattacks due to the high value of the data it holds.  Common threats and vulnerabilities include:

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Deceiving employees into revealing credentials or installing malware.
*   **Malware:** Viruses, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware designed to steal data, disrupt operations, or extort money.
*   **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or unintentional actions by employees or contractors.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks:** Overwhelming systems to disrupt service.
*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access to databases.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into websites to steal user information.
*   **Vulnerable Third-Party Vendors:**  Compromised vendors can provide an entry point into the organization's systems.
*   **Weak Password Policies:**  Easy-to-guess or reused passwords.
*   **Lack of Patch Management:**  Unpatched software vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data.

**Step 2: Understanding the "Low" Risk Scenario**

In the context of risk management, "Low" typically implies:

*   **Security Exposure:** The vulnerability exists, but the attack surface or potential impact is limited. It might affect non-critical systems or data with limited sensitivity.
*   **Impact:** The potential damage from a successful exploit is minor. This could include temporary disruption of a non-essential service, minor data loss, or slight reputational damage.
*   **Likelihood:** The probability of the vulnerability being exploited is low, either because it's difficult to exploit or because it's not a common target.

While "Low," it is important not to ignore the risk. Cumulative minor impacts can create significant problems, and even low-likelihood events can occur.

**Step 3: PCI DSS Relevance**

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a mandatory standard for any organization that handles credit card information. Even for "Low" risk areas, PCI DSS provides specific requirements to consider:

*   **Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data:** Even for lower-risk scenarios, consider if *any* cardholder data is involved. Implement encryption and other measures to protect it.
*   **Requirement 5: Protect All Systems Against Malware and Regularly Update Antivirus Software or Programs:** Malware can potentially elevate a low risk to high if it is not detected or stopped early.
*   **Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications:** Applies to all systems, not just high-risk ones. Patch management and secure coding practices are still necessary.
*   **Requirement 7: Restrict Access to Cardholder Data by Business Need-to-Know:** Limiting access minimizes the potential impact of a breach, even a small one.
*   **Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components:** Secure password policies, multi-factor authentication (if feasible), and access controls are important.
*   **Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data:** Physical security measures (e.g., locked server rooms, security cameras) are still relevant.
*   **Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data:**  Logging and monitoring can detect suspicious activity early.
*   **Requirement 11: Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes:** Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can identify weaknesses.
*   **Requirement 12: Maintain a Policy that Addresses Information Security for All Personnel:** This document is part of that policy.

**Step 4: Best Practices and Controls**

Appropriate controls for a "Low" risk situation should be cost-effective and proportionate to the risk.  These might include:

*   **Basic Security Awareness Training:** Teach employees to identify phishing attempts and other common scams.
*   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex passwords and regular password changes.
*   **Regular Patch Management:** Keep systems and software up-to-date with security patches.
*   **Limited Access Controls:** Restrict access to sensitive data to those who need it.
*   **Basic Firewall Protection:** Protect network perimeters.
*   **Antivirus Software:** Install and maintain antivirus software on all systems.
*   **Regular Backups:** Back up data regularly to ensure business continuity.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan in place to respond to security incidents.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses.
*   **Reviewing Logs Regularly:** Reviewing logs regularly for unusual or suspicious activity.

**Cybersecurity Policy**

Here's the Cybersecurity Policy document:

```
**Cybersecurity Policy**

**1. Introduction**

1.1 Purpose:
This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the organization's commitment to protecting its information assets and maintaining a secure computing environment. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals who access the organization's systems or data.  This policy addresses the management of cybersecurity risks, including those categorized as "Low," while adhering to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) where applicable.

1.2 Scope:
This policy covers all information assets owned or controlled by the organization, including but not limited to: hardware, software, data, networks, and cloud-based services.

1.3 Policy Owner:
[Name/Title of Policy Owner â€“ e.g., Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)]

**2. Risk Assessment**

2.1 Risk Management Framework:
The organization employs a risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks. This framework includes regular risk assessments to determine the likelihood and impact of potential threats. Risks are categorized based on a defined scale (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

2.2 Low Risk Definition:
A "Low" risk is defined as a vulnerability or threat that has a limited potential impact on the organization's systems, data, or operations. The likelihood of exploitation is also considered low. Examples might include vulnerabilities in non-critical internal systems or public-facing web pages that do not handle sensitive data.

2.3 Risk Acceptance Criteria:
While "Low" risks may not require immediate remediation, they are still managed and monitored. Mitigation strategies are implemented based on a cost-benefit analysis, considering the resources required versus the potential impact.

**3. Data Protection**

3.1 Data Classification:
All data is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  Even for low-risk systems, data should be classified to understand its value and protection requirements.

3.2 Data Handling Procedures:
Employees must adhere to data handling procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This includes proper storage, transmission, and disposal of data.

3.3 PCI DSS Considerations:
Even if a system is considered "Low" risk overall, if it handles any cardholder data (even if indirectly or for a short period), PCI DSS requirements related to data protection *must* be followed. This includes encryption, access controls, and secure disposal of cardholder data.

**4. Access Controls**

4.1 Principle of Least Privilege:
Access to systems and data is granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users are granted only the access necessary to perform their job duties.

4.2 Password Management:
All users are required to adhere to a strong password policy, which includes:
    *   Minimum password length of 12 characters.
    *   Use of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Regular password changes (at least every 90 days).
    *   Prohibition of password reuse.

4.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
MFA is encouraged for all systems and is required for systems that handle sensitive data or provide access to critical infrastructure.

4.4 Account Management:
User accounts are promptly created, modified, and terminated based on employee onboarding, job changes, and terminations.

**5. Incident Response**

5.1 Incident Reporting:
All security incidents, including suspected incidents, must be reported immediately to the IT Security team or designated incident response personnel.

5.2 Incident Response Plan:
The organization maintains an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents. The IRP is reviewed and updated regularly.

5.3 Low Risk Incident Handling:
Even for incidents involving "Low" risk systems, the IRP must be followed. This ensures that the incident is properly documented, contained, and remediated. Lessons learned are incorporated into future training and policy updates.

**6. Security Awareness Training**
