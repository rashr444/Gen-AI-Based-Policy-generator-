Here's a comprehensive cybersecurity policy tailored for a low-risk healthcare environment, aligned with COBIT, and addressing the feedback you provided.

--Cybersecurity Policy--

--1. Introduction--

-   --Purpose:-- This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and systems belonging to [Healthcare Organization Name] (the "Organization").  It applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals or entities accessing, using, or managing Organization information assets.  This policy is designed to be scalable and adapt as the Organization and its risk profile evolve.

-   --Scope:-- This Policy covers all information assets, including but not limited to electronic protected health information (ePHI), financial records, operational data, and intellectual property, regardless of location (on-premises, cloud, or mobile). It encompasses all information systems, networks, devices, and applications used to create, store, process, or transmit Organization data.

-   --Compliance:-- This Policy aligns with applicable laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and utilizes the COBIT framework for governance and management of information and technology. The COBIT framework helps us achieve our objectives by aligning IT processes with business goals and ensuring accountability.

The [Designated Role, e.g., Security Officer, IT Director] is responsible for maintaining and updating this Policy.

--2. Risk Assessment--

-   --Process:-- The Organization conducts regular risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information assets. Risk assessments will be performed at least annually and whenever there is a significant change to the Organization's environment (e.g., new systems, applications, or business processes).

-   --Methodology:-- The risk assessment process will utilize a methodology consistent with industry best practices (e.g., NIST Risk Management Framework, ISO 27005) to:
    -   Identify assets and their value.
    -   Identify potential threats (e.g., malware, phishing, unauthorized access, natural disasters).
    -   Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.
    -   Analyze the likelihood and impact of potential risks.
    -   Prioritize risks based on their severity.

-   --Risk Mitigation:-- Based on the risk assessment results, the Organization will implement appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks. Risk mitigation strategies may include:
    -   Implementing technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption).
    -   Implementing administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training).
    -   Transferring risk (e.g., insurance).
    -   Accepting risk (with documented justification).

-   --Physical Security:--  The Organization maintains physical security measures to protect its facilities and information assets from unauthorized access, damage, or theft.  These measures include:
    -   --Access Control:-- Limited access to facilities through keycard access, reception/security personnel, and visitor sign-in procedures.
    -   --Security Cameras:-- Security cameras monitoring entrances, exits, and other critical areas.
    -   --Environmental Controls:-- Measures to protect equipment from environmental hazards (e.g., fire suppression, climate control).
    -   --Visitor Management:-- All visitors are required to sign in, provide identification, and be escorted while on the premises.

--3. Data Protection--

-   --Data Security Measures:--  The following measures are implemented to protect data:
    -   --Encryption:-- Sensitive data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.  This includes ePHI, financial data, and other confidential information.
    -   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Monitoring and prevention measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Organization's control without authorization. This might include monitoring email, web traffic, and removable media.
    -   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely, with a documented recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss incident. Backups will be tested regularly.
    -   --Data Retention and Disposal:--  Data will be retained according to legal and regulatory requirements and the Organization's data retention policy.  Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using approved methods (e.g., shredding, degaussing, secure wiping).

-   --Privacy:-- The Organization respects the privacy of patients and adheres to all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including HIPAA.  Employees are trained on their responsibilities for protecting patient privacy.

--4. Access Controls--

-   --Principle of Least Privilege:--  Access to information systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that users will only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties.

-   --User Account Management:--
    -   Unique user accounts will be created for each individual accessing the Organization's systems.
    -   Strong passwords will be required and enforced.  Password complexity requirements will be regularly reviewed and updated.
    -   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented for all critical systems and remote access.
    -   User accounts will be promptly disabled or terminated when an individual leaves the Organization or changes roles.
    -   Regular reviews of user access rights will be conducted to ensure they remain appropriate.
