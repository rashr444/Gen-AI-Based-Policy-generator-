--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security requirements for [Organization Name] ("the Organization") to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals or entities accessing, using, or managing the Organization's information systems and data, regardless of location or device type.  This policy is designed to meet compliance requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) for low-risk environments.  Adherence to this policy is essential to maintaining the trust of our patients, partners, and the public. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

-   --Purpose:--  To establish a framework for safeguarding information assets against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
-   --Scope:--  This policy covers all information systems, networks, applications, devices (including but not limited to computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones), data (including PHI), and physical locations owned or controlled by the Organization, as well as those used to access or process Organization data.
-   --Audience:-- This policy is written for a diverse audience, including executive leadership, clinical staff, IT personnel, and administrative employees. Jargon is minimized, and where technical terms are used, clear definitions are provided.

--2. Risk Assessment--

The Organization recognizes that maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture requires continuous risk assessment. Risk assessments are performed to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems.

-   --Risk Assessment Frequency:--  A formal risk assessment will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in the organization's environment (e.g., new systems, new regulations, a major security incident).
-   --Low-Risk Environment Definition:--  For the purposes of this policy, a "low-risk environment" is defined as one characterized by:
    -   --Limited PHI Volume:--  The Organization handles a relatively small volume of PHI.
    -   --Simple IT Infrastructure:--  The IT infrastructure is relatively straightforward, consisting primarily of standard office productivity applications, Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, and basic network services.
    -   --Limited Connectivity:--  The Organization has limited connectivity to external networks beyond essential internet access.
    -   --Limited Mobile Device Usage:--  Employee use of mobile devices for business purposes is controlled and minimized.
    -   --No high-value targets:-- The data is not considered likely to be a high-value target for sophisticated attackers.

    This definition is subject to change based on changes in the organization's environment or threat landscape.  The risk assessment will determine if these conditions still exist, and the policy will be adjusted accordingly.

-   --Risk Assessment Methodology:--  The risk assessment process will follow a recognized framework, such as NIST Special Publication 800-30, "Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems," tailored for a low-risk environment. This includes:
    -   --Identifying Assets:-- Cataloging all relevant hardware, software, data, and personnel.
    -   --Identifying Threats:-- Identifying potential threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and physical security breaches.
    -   --Identifying Vulnerabilities:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
    -   --Analyzing Likelihood and Impact:-- Assessing the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact on the organization.
    -   --Determining Risk Levels:-- Assigning risk levels based on the likelihood and impact assessments.
    -   --Developing Mitigation Strategies:-- Identifying and implementing appropriate security controls to reduce risk to acceptable levels.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment activities and findings will be documented, including the assets assessed, threats identified, vulnerabilities discovered, risk levels assigned, and mitigation strategies implemented.

    -   --Data at Rest:-- Encryption will be used for all sensitive data stored on electronic devices and servers.  For a low-risk environment, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key length of at least 128 bits is the minimum acceptable encryption algorithm.  Key management procedures will follow industry best practices, including the use of strong passwords or multi-factor authentication to protect encryption keys.  Acceptable technologies for data at rest include [Specific tools or software solutions used by the organization, e.g., BitLocker, FileVault].
    -   --Data in Transit:-- Encryption will be used for all sensitive data transmitted over networks, including email, file transfers, and remote access connections.  Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 or higher is the minimum acceptable encryption protocol for data in transit.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of all critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure, disaster, or data loss.
    -   --Backup Frequency:-- Backups will be performed [e.g., daily, weekly] and stored in a secure, off-site location.
    -   --Recovery Testing:--  Data recovery procedures will be tested at least annually to ensure their effectiveness.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- The organization will implement measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control without authorization. These measures may include:
    -   --Monitoring:-- Monitoring network traffic and endpoint devices for unauthorized data transfers.
    -   --Filtering:-- Filtering outbound email and web traffic to prevent the transmission of sensitive data.
    -   --Access Controls:-- Restricting access to sensitive data based on the principle of least privilege.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as required by law, regulation, or business need, and then securely disposed of.
    -   --Retention Policy:-- A data retention policy will be established and followed, specifying the retention periods for different types of data.
    -   --Secure Disposal:--  Data will be securely disposed of using methods that prevent unauthorized access or recovery, such as data wiping or physical destruction of storage media.
