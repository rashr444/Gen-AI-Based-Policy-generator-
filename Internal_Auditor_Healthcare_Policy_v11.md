--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Management Framework--

[Organization Name] utilizes the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks. The RMF process includes:

-   --Categorize:-- Identifying the criticality and sensitivity of information systems and data.
-   --Select:-- Choosing appropriate security controls based on risk assessments and regulatory requirements.
-   --Implement:-- Deploying and configuring selected security controls.
-   --Assess:-- Evaluating the effectiveness of implemented security controls.
-   --Authorize:-- Determining the acceptability of residual risk.
-   --Monitor:-- Continuously monitoring security controls and making adjustments as needed.

--2.2 Risk Assessment Process--

Regular risk assessments will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  These assessments will consider:

-   --Internal Threats:--  Malicious insiders, accidental data breaches, human error.
-   --External Threats:-- Malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, data breaches.
-   --Vulnerabilities:--  Weaknesses in systems, applications, or processes.
-   --Impact:--  Potential consequences of a security breach, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal penalties.
-   --Likelihood:-- Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

Risk assessments will be documented and used to prioritize security investments and mitigation efforts.

--3. Data Protection--
