## Cybersecurity Policy for Low Risk Finance Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security standards for [Company Name], a financial institution operating in a low-risk environment. This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data, including customer financial information, intellectual property, and other confidential business data. It applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other third parties who access or use [Company Name]'s systems and data. This policy is aligned with relevant industry regulations, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and reflects our commitment to maintaining a secure operating environment. Adherence to this policy is a condition of employment or engagement with [Company Name].

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Company Name] conducts regular risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of our systems and data. Given our low-risk environment, these assessments focus on the most likely and impactful scenarios, such as:

-   Phishing attacks targeting employees.
-   Malware infections on workstations.
-   Unauthorized access to sensitive data due to weak passwords or misconfigured access controls.
-   Data breaches resulting from lost or stolen devices.
-   Service disruptions due to denial-of-service attacks.

Risk assessments are conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually, bi-annually] and updated as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape, business operations, and regulatory requirements. The results of these assessments are used to inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls and to prioritize security investments.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is a top priority for [Company Name]. The following measures are in place to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data:

-   --Data Classification:-- All data is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Data classifications guide the application of appropriate security controls.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes encrypting data stored on laptops, portable devices, and cloud storage services.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- DLP measures are implemented to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This includes monitoring network traffic for sensitive data and implementing controls to block unauthorized data transfers.
-   --Secure Data Storage:-- Sensitive data is stored in secure locations with restricted access. Physical security measures are in place to protect data centers and other physical storage locations.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data is retained only as long as necessary for business or legal requirements. When data is no longer needed, it is securely disposed of using approved methods.
-   --Payment Card Data Protection (PCI DSS):-- All cardholder data must be protected in accordance with the PCI DSS. This includes encrypting cardholder data in transit and at rest, implementing access controls to restrict access to cardholder data, and regularly monitoring systems for security vulnerabilities. Specifically, [Company Name] will:
    -   Minimize the storage of cardholder data.
    -   Encrypt all cardholder data when stored.
    -   Use strong cryptography and security protocols to protect cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
    -   Implement and maintain a vulnerability management program.
    -   Implement strong access control measures.
    -   Regularly monitor and test networks.
    -   Maintain an information security policy.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to systems and data is restricted based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users are only granted the access they need to perform their job duties. The following access control measures are in place:

-   --User Authentication:-- All users must authenticate themselves before accessing systems and data. Strong passwords are required, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) is encouraged for sensitive systems.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Access to systems and data is controlled through role-based access control (RBAC). Users are assigned roles based on their job functions, and each role is granted specific access privileges.
-   --Privileged Access Management:-- Access to privileged accounts (e.g., administrator accounts) is strictly controlled and monitored. Privileged access is granted only to authorized personnel and is subject to additional security controls.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:-- Access rights are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are still appropriate. User accounts are disabled promptly when employees leave the organization or change roles.
-   --Physical Access Controls:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas is restricted through the use of access badges, security cameras, and other physical security measures.

### 5. Incident Response

[Company Name] has established an incident response plan to address security incidents in a timely and effective manner. The plan outlines the procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are responsible for reporting suspected security incidents to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Response Team:-- The incident response team is responsible for investigating security incidents, coordinating response efforts, and communicating with stakeholders.
-   --Incident Containment:-- The incident response team will take steps to contain the impact of security incidents, such as isolating affected systems and disabling compromised accounts.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- The incident response team will take steps to eradicate the root cause of security incidents, such as removing malware and patching vulnerabilities.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- The incident response team will take steps to restore affected systems and data to their normal operating state.
-   --Post-Incident Review:-- After each security incident, a post-incident review will be conducted to identify lessons learned and to improve the incident response plan.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees are required to participate in security awareness training on a regular basis. The training covers topics such as:

-   Phishing awareness
-   Password security
-   Data protection
-   Incident reporting
-   Social engineering
-   Mobile device security

The training is designed to educate employees about the threats they face and how to protect themselves and the organization from cyberattacks. [Company Name] may employ simulated phishing exercises to test employees' awareness and identify areas for improvement.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Company Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including PCI DSS. Regular internal and external audits are conducted to assess the effectiveness of our security controls and to identify areas for improvement.

-   --PCI DSS Compliance:-- [Company Name] undergoes regular PCI DSS assessments to validate our compliance with the standard. Any identified gaps in compliance are promptly remediated.
-   --Internal Audits:-- Internal audits are conducted [Frequency - e.g., quarterly, annually] to assess the effectiveness of our security controls. The results of these audits are reported to senior management.
-   --External Audits:-- External audits are conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually, bi-annually] to provide an independent assessment of our security posture.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans are conducted to identify security vulnerabilities in our systems and applications. Identified vulnerabilities are promptly patched.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Penetration testing is conducted [Frequency - e.g., annually, bi-annually] to simulate real-world attacks and to identify weaknesses in our security defenses.
