As an Internal Auditor responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of [Healthcare Organization Name]'s information systems, I am issuing this Cybersecurity Policy. This policy outlines the necessary security controls and procedures to protect our organization's sensitive data, including Protected Health Information (PHI), from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

The healthcare industry is a prime target for cyberattacks due to the high value of patient data. While [Healthcare Organization Name] operates in a generally low-risk environment, primarily focused on [briefly describe the organization's activities, e.g., outpatient care, small practice, etc.], adhering to robust cybersecurity practices is paramount to maintaining patient trust, protecting our reputation, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements, most notably the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This policy is designed to establish a foundational security posture, tailored to our specific operational needs and risk profile. Its implementation and enforcement are crucial for the ongoing security and privacy of our patients' information. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, and any other individuals accessing or using [Healthcare Organization Name]'s information systems and data.
