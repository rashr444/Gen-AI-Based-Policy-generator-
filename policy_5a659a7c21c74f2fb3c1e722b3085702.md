## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environments

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Approved By:** [Your Name/Designation, e.g., CISO]

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security requirements for [Organization Name] in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and other sensitive information. This policy is designed specifically for low-risk environments within the healthcare organization, characterized by limited direct patient care activities, minimal ePHI (electronic Protected Health Information) storage, and restricted network connectivity to critical systems. This policy is aligned with the principles of ISO/IEC 27001 and aims to establish a foundational cybersecurity posture that minimizes risks and promotes a security-conscious culture.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals who access or use [Organization Name]'s information systems and data, regardless of location. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

**2. Risk Assessment**

Given the low-risk environment, a simplified risk assessment process will be implemented and reviewed annually. The assessment will focus on identifying and prioritizing potential threats and vulnerabilities related to the organization's specific operations.

*   **Frequency:** Annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the environment (e.g., new systems, processes, or regulations).
*   **Scope:** Limited to systems and data within the defined low-risk environment.
*   **Methodology:** A qualitative risk assessment approach will be used, focusing on likelihood and impact. Common threats considered will include phishing attacks, malware infections, unauthorized access to data, and loss or theft of devices.
*   **Documentation:**  A Risk Register will be maintained, documenting identified risks, assessed likelihood and impact, and implemented mitigation strategies.
*   **Mitigation:**  For identified risks, appropriate mitigation strategies will be implemented based on the "Risk-based thinking" principle of ISO 27001. These may include technical controls, administrative procedures, and physical security measures.

**3. Data Protection**

Even in a low-risk environment, protecting data is paramount. This section outlines the data protection requirements:

*   **Data Classification:** Data will be classified based on sensitivity (e.g., Confidential, Internal Use Only, Public).  While ePHI storage is limited, any identified ePHI will be classified as Confidential.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encryption of data at rest is not mandatory for systems within this low-risk environment, but encryption of portable storage devices (e.g., USB drives) is required if they contain any sensitive data. Encryption of data in transit (e.g., via HTTPS) is required for web-based applications.
*   **Data Backup:** Regular backups of critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of system failures or data loss. Backup frequency and retention policies will be defined based on the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each system.  Backups must be stored in a secure location, physically separated from the primary data.
*   **Data Disposal:**  Data must be securely disposed of when no longer needed. This includes wiping or physically destroying storage media. Deletion alone is not sufficient.
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP tools are not required, but users should be trained to avoid accidentally or intentionally sharing sensitive data through unsecured channels.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to systems and data within the low-risk environment will be managed based on the principle of least privilege.

*   **User Authentication:**  Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Multifactor authentication (MFA) is recommended, where technically feasible.
*   **Access Authorization:** Access to systems and data will be granted based on job role and responsibilities. Regular access reviews will be conducted to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need.
*   **Account Management:**  A formal process for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts will be implemented. User accounts will be promptly disabled upon termination of employment or change in job role.
*   **Remote Access:**  Remote access to systems within the low-risk environment is restricted. If remote access is necessary, it must be secured through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with strong authentication.
*   **Physical Access:**  Physical access to server rooms and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Access control mechanisms (e.g., key cards, biometric scanners) should be implemented where appropriate.

**5. Incident Response**

A simplified incident response plan will be implemented to handle security incidents effectively.

*   **Incident Reporting:** All employees are responsible for reporting suspected security incidents to [Designated Contact/Team, e.g., IT Help Desk, Security Officer].
*   **Incident Classification:** Incidents will be classified based on severity and impact.
*   **Incident Handling:**  A defined incident handling process will be followed, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Documentation:** All security incidents will be documented, including the nature of the incident, the steps taken to resolve it, and any lessons learned.
*   **Escalation:**  Serious security incidents will be escalated to [Designated Contact/Team] for further investigation and response.  Legal and regulatory reporting requirements will be followed as necessary.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training is crucial for promoting a security-conscious culture.

*   **Frequency:** Annual security awareness training will be provided to all employees and contractors.
*   **Content:**  Training will cover topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, and incident reporting.
*   **Delivery Method:**  Training can be delivered through online modules, presentations, or other appropriate methods.
*   **Documentation:**  Attendance at security awareness training will be tracked and documented.
*   **Phishing Simulations:**  Regular phishing simulations are recommended to test employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Compliance with this policy will be monitored through regular audits and reviews.

*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if necessary, to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
*   **Internal Audits:** Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and identify any gaps in security controls.
*   **External Audits:**  If required by regulations or contractual obligations, external audits may be conducted by qualified third-party auditors.
*   **Compliance Reporting:**  Reports on compliance with this policy will be provided to [Designated Stakeholder, e.g., Management, Audit Committee].
*   **ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment:** While not seeking formal certification, the organization will strive to maintain alignment with relevant ISO/IEC 27001 controls for its defined scope.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting information assets within the low-risk environment of [Organization Name]. Adherence to this policy is essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data and other sensitive information, and for complying with applicable laws and regulations. All employees and contractors are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Regular review and updates will ensure the policy remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving threats.
