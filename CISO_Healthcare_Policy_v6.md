Okay, here's a revised cybersecurity policy tailored to a "low-risk" healthcare environment, keeping RMF compliance in mind and addressing the weaknesses identified in the evaluation feedback.  I've aimed for clarity and accessibility for a diverse audience.

--Cybersecurity Policy for [Organization Name]--

--Effective Date:-- [Date]
--Revision Date:-- [Date]
--Approved By:-- [Name and Title]

--1. Introduction--

-   --Purpose:-- This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security measures required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data managed by [Organization Name].  While we operate in what is considered a comparatively "low-risk" segment of the healthcare industry, the potential impact of a data breach involving PHI remains significant. Therefore, this policy establishes a framework to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF).
-   --Scope:-- This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems, networks, and data, regardless of location or device.  This includes but is not limited to workstations, laptops, mobile devices, servers, cloud services, and any physical or digital media containing organizational data.
-   --Policy Objectives:--
    -   Protect PHI and other sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
    -   Maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data.
    -   Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including HIPAA, HITECH, and the Risk Management Framework (RMF).
    -   Establish a culture of security awareness and accountability among all personnel.
    -   Provide a framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
    -   Respond effectively to security incidents and breaches.
-   --Policy Statement:-- [Organization Name] is committed to maintaining a robust cybersecurity program that protects its information assets and ensures the privacy and security of patient data.  We will continuously improve our security posture through ongoing risk assessments, implementation of appropriate controls, and regular monitoring and auditing.

--2. Risk Assessment--

-   --Risk Management Framework (RMF) Alignment:-- This policy is aligned with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to systematically manage cybersecurity risks. The RMF process involves:
    1.  --Categorize:-- Categorize information systems and data based on their sensitivity and criticality.
    2.  --Select:-- Select security controls from the NIST 800-53 or other applicable control catalog.
    3.  --Implement:-- Implement the selected security controls.
    4.  --Assess:-- Assess the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.
    5.  --Authorize:-- Authorize the operation of the information system.
    6.  --Monitor:-- Continuously monitor the security controls and the system's security posture.
-   --Risk Assessment Process:--  [Organization Name] will conduct a comprehensive risk assessment at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in the organization's environment, such as new technologies, business processes, or threat landscape. The risk assessment will:
    -   Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to information systems and data.
    -   Assess the likelihood and impact of identified threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
    -   Determine the overall level of risk.
    -   Prioritize risks for mitigation.
    -   Document the risk assessment process and findings.
-   --Risk Mitigation:--  Based on the risk assessment results, [Organization Name] will implement appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks.  Risk mitigation strategies may include:
    -   Implementing technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption).
    -   Implementing administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training).
    -   Transferring risk (e.g., cyber insurance).
    -   Accepting risk (with documented justification).
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning of all servers and workstations on the network to remediate vulnerabilities.

--3. Data Protection--

-   --Data Classification:--  All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  Classification levels may include:
    -   --Highly Sensitive:--  PHI, financial information, employee records, and other data requiring the highest level of protection.
    -   --Sensitive:-- Confidential business information, internal communications, and data requiring protection against unauthorized disclosure.
    -   --Public:--  Information intended for public dissemination.
-   --Data Encryption:--
    -   --Data in Transit:-- All data transmitted over public networks (e.g., the internet) must be encrypted using strong encryption protocols such as TLS 1.2 or higher with cipher suites following industry best practices (e.g., ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384).
    -   --Data at Rest:--  Sensitive data stored on any device, including laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and servers, must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256.

Backup procedures will be tested regularly to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner in the event of a disaster.  [Specify backup frequency, retention policies, and recovery time objectives].
-   --Data Disposal:--  Data must be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed.  This includes:
    -   Shredding paper documents containing sensitive information.
    -   Wiping or destroying electronic media using secure data sanitization methods (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M standard).
    -   Physically destroying hard drives and other storage devices.
