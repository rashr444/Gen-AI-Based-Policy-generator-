## Cybersecurity Policy for Financial Institutions (Medium Risk)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Effective Date:** November 26, 2023
**Policy Owner:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
**Approved By:** Executive Management

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the mandatory security requirements for all employees, contractors, vendors, and other authorized users (collectively, "Users") of [Company Name], a financial institution operating within a medium-risk environment. This Policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of [Company Name]'s information assets, including financial data, customer information, and proprietary business intelligence.  It is aligned with industry best practices and regulatory compliance standards, specifically leveraging the COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) framework to ensure effective governance and management of IT-related risks.  This Policy applies to all systems, networks, applications, and devices owned, leased, or used by [Company Name] for business purposes, regardless of location.  Non-compliance with this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

**2. Risk Assessment**

[Company Name] conducts regular risk assessments, at least annually and following significant changes to the IT environment or business operations, to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. These risk assessments are based on a combination of factors, including:

*   **Threat Intelligence:** Monitoring current and emerging cyber threats affecting the financial industry.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scanning systems and applications for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Periodically conducting simulated attacks to identify weaknesses in security controls.
*   **Data Classification:** Categorizing data based on sensitivity and business impact.

The results of these risk assessments are used to prioritize security investments and implement appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks.  The risk assessment methodology is aligned with COBIT framework (specifically, APO12 Manage Risk and MEA02 Monitor, Evaluate and Assess Risk).  Risk treatment options include acceptance, avoidance, transfer, or mitigation, with documented justification for each decision.

**3. Data Protection**

Protecting sensitive data is paramount.  This section outlines the requirements for data protection at rest and in transit.

*   **Data Classification:** All data must be classified based on its sensitivity and business criticality, using a predefined classification scheme (e.g., Confidential, Restricted, Internal, Public).  Data classification labels must be applied consistently to all relevant systems and documents.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data at rest (e.g., on servers, laptops, mobile devices, databases) must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). Sensitive data in transit (e.g., email, file transfers, web browsing) must be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher, VPN).
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP solutions must be implemented to monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data outside of the company network.
*   **Data Retention and Disposal:** Data must be retained according to legal and regulatory requirements and business needs.  Data must be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using approved data sanitization methods (e.g., overwriting, degaussing, physical destruction).
*   **Backups and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data and systems must be performed and stored securely offsite.  Recovery procedures must be tested regularly to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster or data loss event.  Data protection measures align with COBIT's DSS05 Manage Security Services control objective.

**4. Access Controls**

Access to systems and data must be restricted to authorized users based on the principle of least privilege.

*   **User Authentication:** Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), must be used for all access to critical systems and applications.  Weak passwords are prohibited. Password complexity requirements must adhere to industry best practices (e.g., NIST guidelines).
*   **Access Management:** User access privileges must be granted based on job role and business need.  Access requests must be approved by appropriate business owners.  User access privileges must be reviewed regularly, at least annually, and revoked promptly upon termination or change of role.
*   **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Privileged accounts (e.g., administrator accounts) must be tightly controlled and monitored.  The use of shared accounts is discouraged.  PAM solutions should be implemented to manage and audit privileged access.
*   **Remote Access:** Remote access to the network must be secured using VPNs and MFA.  Remote access policies must be enforced.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  The network must be segmented to limit the impact of a security breach.  Critical systems and data should be isolated from less sensitive areas of the network. Access control aligns with COBIT's DSS05 Manage Security Services and APO13 Manage Security control objectives.

**5. Incident Response**

A comprehensive incident response plan is essential for managing and mitigating security incidents.

*   **Incident Reporting:** All security incidents, or suspected security incidents, must be reported immediately to the IT Security team or designated contact.
*   **Incident Response Team:** A designated Incident Response Team (IRT) must be responsible for managing and responding to security incidents.  The IRT must include representatives from IT, Security, Legal, and Public Relations.
*   **Incident Response Process:** The incident response plan must outline the steps to be taken to identify, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security incidents.  The incident response process must be documented and tested regularly.
*   **Incident Communication:** Communication protocols must be established to ensure timely and accurate communication of incident details to stakeholders, including employees, customers, and regulatory authorities.
*   **Post-Incident Review:** A post-incident review must be conducted after each significant security incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
Incident Response plan align with COBIT's DSS02 Manage Service Requests, Incidents and Problems control objective.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training is crucial for educating Users about cybersecurity threats and best practices.

*   **Mandatory Training:** All Users must complete mandatory security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter.
*   **Training Content:** Training content must cover topics such as phishing awareness, malware prevention, password security, data protection, social engineering, and incident reporting.
*   **Training Delivery:** Training can be delivered through a variety of methods, including online modules, classroom sessions, and simulated phishing exercises.
*   **Training Tracking:**  Completion of security awareness training must be tracked and documented.
*   **Ongoing Awareness:**  Security awareness should be reinforced through regular communications, such as newsletters, posters, and security alerts. Training aligns with COBIT's APO14 Manage Data control objective.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Compliance with this Policy and relevant regulations is essential.

*   **Policy Enforcement:** The IT Security team is responsible for enforcing this Policy.
*   **Policy Review:** This Policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or business operations.
*   **Internal Audits:** Internal audits must be conducted regularly to assess compliance with this Policy and identify any weaknesses in security controls. Audit findings must be reported to management and addressed promptly.
*   **External Audits:** External audits may be required to comply with regulatory requirements or industry standards.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** [Company Name] must comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulations, including [mention specific regulations relevant to the finance industry, e.g., GLBA, PCI DSS, GDPR]. Compliance and Auditing aligns with COBIT's MEA03 Manage Compliance with External Requirements control objective.
