## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations in Low-Risk Environments

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security standards and procedures for [Organization Name], a healthcare organization operating in a low-risk environment. This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) and other sensitive data in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including alignment with ISO/IEC 27001. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information systems and data.

--2. Risk Assessment--

[Organization Name] conducts regular risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information assets. Due to the low-risk environment, these assessments will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur in our environment or threat landscape. The risk assessment process will:

-   Identify critical assets and data.
-   Identify potential threats (e.g., phishing, malware, unauthorized access) and vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords).
-   Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks to an acceptable level.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and reviewed by senior management. Remediation plans will be developed and tracked to completion.

--3. Data Protection--

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data, including ePHI.

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Policies and procedures will be implemented to ensure that data is handled and protected appropriately based on its classification.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Encryption will be implemented on laptops, mobile devices, and servers storing sensitive data.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backups will be stored securely and tested regularly to ensure their recoverability. Offsite backups will be appropriately secured to prevent unauthorized access.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Measures will be implemented to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control without authorization. This may include monitoring data egress points, implementing data loss prevention software, and educating employees on data handling procedures.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained for the period required by law and business needs. When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using approved methods.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to information systems and data will be controlled based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- All users will be required to authenticate themselves before accessing information systems and data. Strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible, and regular password resets will be enforced.
-   --Access Authorization:-- Access to data and systems will be granted based on job role and need-to-know. Access rights will be reviewed and updated regularly, especially upon employee termination or change of role.
-   --Privileged Access Management:-- Access to privileged accounts will be strictly controlled and monitored. Privileged access will be granted only to authorized personnel and used only for legitimate business purposes.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to [Organization Name]'s network will be secured using VPNs and multi-factor authentication.

-   --Incident Response Team:-- A designated incident response team will be responsible for investigating and responding to security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Procedures will be in place to contain the spread of security incidents and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Procedures will be in place to remove the cause of the security incident.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures will be in place to restore systems and data to their normal operating state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and prevent future occurrences.
-   --Notification Procedures:-- Processes are established for notifying affected individuals and regulatory agencies as required by law and policy.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

[Organization Name] will provide regular security awareness training to all employees, contractors, and vendors.

-   --Training Content:-- Training will cover topics such as phishing awareness, password security, data handling procedures, incident reporting, and social engineering.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Security awareness training will be provided to new employees during onboarding and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training will be delivered through a variety of methods, such as online modules, classroom training, and simulated phishing exercises.
