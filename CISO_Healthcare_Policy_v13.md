Okay, here's a revised cybersecurity policy addressing the feedback and tailored for a low-risk healthcare environment, aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 principles. It's structured to be accessible to a broad audience while maintaining the necessary level of detail.

--Cybersecurity Policy - [Healthcare Organization Name]--

--Version:-- 1.0
--Date Issued:-- October 26, 2023
--Review Cycle:-- Annually (or more frequently upon significant organizational or technological change)
--Approved by:-- [Name and Title of Approving Authority - e.g., Chief Executive Officer, Compliance Officer]

--1. Introduction--

--1.1 Purpose:--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory requirements and best practices that [Healthcare Organization Name] (hereinafter referred to as "the Organization") must adhere to in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets and systems. This policy aims to safeguard patient data, ensure business continuity, and maintain compliance with applicable laws, regulations (including HIPAA where applicable), and industry standards, specifically considering the principles of ISO/IEC 27001.  It applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using the Organization's information systems or data, regardless of location.

--1.2 Scope:--

This policy covers all aspects of cybersecurity, including but not limited to:

-   All information assets, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), paper records, and intellectual property.
-   All information systems, networks, devices (including workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and servers), and applications owned, leased, or used by the Organization.
-   All physical locations housing the Organization's information assets.
-   All third-party service providers with access to the Organization's information assets.

--1.3 Objectives:--

-   Establish a robust cybersecurity framework aligned with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
-   Protect patient privacy and comply with HIPAA (if applicable) and other relevant regulations.
-   Minimize the risk of data breaches, cyberattacks, and other security incidents.
-   Ensure business continuity and minimize disruption to patient care.
-   Promote a culture of security awareness and responsibility throughout the Organization.

--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Management Framework:--

The Organization adopts a risk-based approach to cybersecurity.  This means that security controls are implemented based on the assessed level of risk to our information assets.  Our risk management framework consists of the following stages:

-   --Risk Identification:-- Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information assets.
-   --Risk Assessment:-- Analyzing the likelihood and impact of identified risks to determine their overall severity.
-   --Risk Treatment:-- Selecting and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept identified risks.  Risk treatment options are evaluated based on cost-effectiveness and alignment with the Organization's risk appetite.
-   --Risk Monitoring:-- Continuously monitoring the effectiveness of implemented controls and reassessing risks as the threat landscape evolves.
-   --Communication and Consultation:--  Regularly communicating risk assessment findings and treatment plans to relevant stakeholders and consulting with them on risk-related decisions.

--2.2 Risk Appetite and Tolerance:--

The Organization has a --low-- risk appetite for threats that could compromise patient data or disrupt critical business operations. We have a --medium-- risk appetite for threats that cause minor business interruptions. A documented risk register that is reviewed at least annually will contain further information.  Risk tolerance levels are defined based on the potential impact of a security incident, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.  Risks exceeding our tolerance levels require immediate attention and remediation.  The risk register is maintained by the [Designated Role, e.g., IT Security Officer] and is reviewed at least annually, or more frequently as needed.

--2.3 Risk Assessment Process:--

The organization conducts regular risk assessments (at least annually, and more frequently in response to significant changes) to identify, analyze, and evaluate cybersecurity risks.  These assessments consider factors such as:

-   The value of information assets.
-   The likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerabilities.
-   The potential impact of a successful attack.
-   Applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

The risk assessment process is documented and includes:

-   --Identification of assets:-- A comprehensive list of all information assets within the Organization's scope.
-   --Threat identification:-- A list of potential threats to the Organization's information assets.
-   --Vulnerability assessment:-- An evaluation of the weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
-   --Likelihood and impact assessment:-- An analysis of the probability and potential consequences of a successful attack.
-   --Risk prioritization:-- Ranking identified risks based on their severity.
-   --Development of risk treatment plans:--  A detailed plan for mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting each identified risk.

--2.4 Roles and Responsibilities:--

-   The [Designated Role, e.g., IT Security Officer] is responsible for conducting risk assessments and developing risk treatment plans.
-   Department heads are responsible for identifying and managing risks within their respective departments.
-   All employees are responsible for reporting any potential security risks they identify.

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification:--

All data within the Organization is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  This classification determines the appropriate level of protection required.  The following data classification levels are used:

-   --Confidential:--  Data that, if disclosed without authorization, could cause significant harm to the Organization or its patients (e.g., ePHI, financial records, trade secrets).  Requires the highest level of protection, including encryption, strict access controls, and secure storage.
-   --Internal:--  Data that is intended for internal use only and could cause moderate harm if disclosed (e.g., internal policies, procedures, and employee information).  Requires appropriate access controls and protection against unauthorized disclosure.
-   --Public:--  Data that is publicly available or intended for public release (e.g., marketing materials, public website content).  Requires basic security measures to ensure integrity and availability.

--3.2 Data Encryption:--

Confidential data, both at rest and in transit, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.  Encryption keys must be securely managed and protected.

-   --Data at rest:-- Encryption is required for all hard drives on laptops and desktops containing ePHI, and for all servers storing confidential data.
-   --Data in transit:-- Encryption is required for all network traffic transmitting ePHI or other confidential data.  Secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP, VPN) must be used for all external communications.

--3.3 Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--

The Organization implements DLP measures to prevent the unauthorized transfer of confidential data outside of the organization's control.  This includes:

-   Monitoring network traffic for potential data leaks.
-   Controlling access to removable media (e.g., USB drives).
