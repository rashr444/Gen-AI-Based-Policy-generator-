## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy is designed to establish a culture of security awareness and to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals who access or use the organization's information systems and data. Given the designation of a low-risk environment, this policy emphasizes foundational security controls and practices appropriate to that risk level, while still maintaining a strong security posture and promoting continuous improvement.

--2. Risk Assessment--

A risk assessment will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur within the organization's IT environment or threat landscape. This assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to ePHI and other sensitive data, assess the likelihood and impact of these threats, and prioritize risks for remediation. The risk assessment methodology will be based on the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and will consider the following:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Comprehensive inventory of all hardware, software, and data assets.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identification of potential threats such as malware, phishing, ransomware, insider threats, and physical security breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identification of weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats. This includes regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, as appropriate for the risk profile.
-   --Impact Analysis:-- Evaluation of the potential impact of a successful attack, including financial loss, reputational damage, legal liability, and disruption of patient care.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Ranking of risks based on likelihood and impact, focusing resources on the most critical vulnerabilities.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and used to inform the development and implementation of security controls.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI is paramount. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption will be used to protect ePHI at rest (stored on devices and servers) and in transit (transmitted over networks). Encryption methods will adhere to industry standards.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. This includes monitoring network traffic, email communications, and removable media for unauthorized data transfers.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored in a secure off-site location. Data recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure timely restoration of data in the event of a disaster.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Data collection will be limited to what is necessary for providing patient care and conducting business operations. Data retention policies will be established to ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary.
-   --Data Sanitization:-- When disposing of electronic devices or storage media, data will be securely erased or destroyed using methods that meet or exceed industry standards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and unique user IDs will be required for accessing systems and applications that contain ePHI.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access permissions will be assigned based on job roles and responsibilities. Only individuals with a legitimate business need will be granted access to specific data and systems.
-   --Access Reviews:-- Periodic reviews of user access privileges will be conducted to ensure that access remains appropriate and necessary.
-   --Remote Access Security:-- Secure remote access methods, such as VPNs, will be used to protect data when accessed from outside the organization's network.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other sensitive areas will be restricted and monitored to prevent unauthorized entry.

--5. Incident Response--

A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed and maintained to address security incidents, such as data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access attempts. The plan will outline the roles and responsibilities of incident response team members, procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents, and communication protocols for notifying stakeholders.

-   --Incident Detection:-- Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity and potential security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Isolate affected systems and prevent further damage or data loss.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Remove the cause of the incident, such as malware or vulnerabilities.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Restore affected systems and data to normal operation.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Conduct a thorough analysis of each incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Reporting:-- Report security incidents to appropriate authorities as required by law or regulation.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices. Training will cover topics such as:

-   --Password Security:-- Creating strong passwords and avoiding common password mistakes.
-   --Phishing Awareness:-- Identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Malware Prevention:-- Understanding how malware spreads and how to prevent infection.
-   --Data Protection:-- Protecting sensitive data and complying with data protection policies.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Reporting suspected security incidents.
-   --Social Engineering:-- Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.

Training will be tailored to the specific roles and responsibilities of individuals within the organization. Refresher training will be provided at least annually.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

This organization will maintain compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

-   --Regular Audits:-- Periodic audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy and other security requirements.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular scans will be performed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- As appropriate for the risk profile, penetration testing will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the organization's security posture.
-   --Compliance Reporting:-- Regular reports will be generated to document compliance efforts and identify areas for improvement.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI and other sensitive data. By implementing the controls and practices outlined in this policy, the organization can effectively manage cybersecurity risks, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and maintain the trust of its patients and stakeholders. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and business operations. All personnel are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy.
