## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the security measures implemented to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. It is designed to comply with relevant regulations, including ISO/IEC 27001, while acknowledging and addressing the specific risks associated with our operational environment, which is currently classified as a low-risk environment. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities with access to our information systems and data. Adherence to this policy is mandatory and essential for maintaining the security and trust necessary for providing quality healthcare services.

--2. Risk Assessment--

Given our classification as a low-risk environment, we conduct a simplified, yet comprehensive, risk assessment process. This involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, evaluating the likelihood and impact of these risks, and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate them.

-   --Scope:-- The risk assessment covers all information systems, networks, applications, and physical locations where PHI and other sensitive data are stored, processed, or transmitted.
-   --Methodology:-- Our methodology includes a combination of self-assessment questionnaires, vulnerability scans (conducted at least annually), and reviews of industry best practices. We focus on readily exploitable vulnerabilities and common attack vectors such as phishing, malware, and weak access controls.
-   --Risk Register:-- We maintain a risk register documenting identified risks, their likelihood and impact, and the corresponding mitigation measures. This register is reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed based on changes in the threat landscape or our operational environment.
-   --Acceptable Risk Levels:-- Due to the "low risk" classification, we have defined specific thresholds for acceptable risk levels. Any risks exceeding these thresholds must be escalated to management for further review and action. These thresholds are clearly defined and documented in our risk management procedures.

--3. Data Protection--

Protecting patient data and other sensitive information is paramount. We implement the following data protection measures:

-   --Data Classification:-- All data is classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. This classification determines the appropriate level of protection required.
-   --Encryption:-- Encryption is used to protect PHI and other sensitive data both in transit (e.g., via HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., encrypting hard drives and databases).
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- While comprehensive DLP solutions are not typically required in low-risk environments, we implement basic DLP measures, such as monitoring for unusual data transfer activity and educating employees on secure data handling practices.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data are performed and stored securely, both onsite and offsite. Recovery procedures are documented and tested regularly to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner in the event of a data loss incident.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data is retained only as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements. When data is no longer needed, it is securely disposed of using approved methods to prevent unauthorized access.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to PHI and other sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel only, based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Account Management:-- All users are assigned unique usernames and strong passwords. Password complexity requirements are enforced, and users are required to change their passwords regularly. Inactive user accounts are promptly disabled or removed.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access to data and systems is granted based on job roles and responsibilities. Users are only granted the minimum level of access required to perform their duties.
-   --Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):-- MFA is implemented for critical systems and applications, such as those containing PHI or financial data.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to our network and systems is secured using VPNs and other appropriate security measures. Remote access is granted only to authorized personnel and is subject to strict access controls and monitoring.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to our facilities and data centers is restricted to authorized personnel only. Access is controlled through the use of access cards, security cameras, and other physical security measures.

--5. Incident Response--

We have established an incident response plan to address cybersecurity incidents in a timely and effective manner.

-   --Incident Response Team (IRT):-- An IRT is responsible for managing and coordinating the response to cybersecurity incidents. The IRT includes representatives from IT, security, legal, and communications.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the IT department or the IRT.
-   --Incident Classification:-- Incidents are classified based on their severity and impact.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Measures are taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- The root cause of the incident is identified and eliminated.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Affected systems and data are restored to their normal operating state.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- A post-incident analysis is conducted to identify lessons learned and improve our security posture.
-   --Incident Response Plan Testing:-- The Incident Response Plan is tested annually through tabletop exercises or simulations.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

Security awareness training is provided to all employees, contractors, and vendors to educate them on cybersecurity threats and best practices.

-   --Training Content:-- Training covers topics such as password security, phishing awareness, malware prevention, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Training Frequency:-- Training is provided to all new employees upon hire and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training is delivered through a variety of methods, including online modules, classroom sessions, and awareness campaigns.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Periodic phishing simulations are conducted to test employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards, including ISO/IEC 27001.

-   --Regular Audits:-- Internal audits are conducted annually to assess compliance with this policy and relevant regulations. External audits are conducted periodically to provide independent assurance of our security posture.
-   --Compliance Reporting:-- Compliance status is reported to management regularly.
-   --Policy Review:-- This policy is reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed based on changes in the threat landscape or our operational environment.
-   --Documentation:-- Complete and accurate documentation of all security policies, procedures, and controls is maintained.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting PHI and other sensitive data in our low-risk environment. While our risk profile is currently considered low, we recognize that the threat landscape is constantly evolving. We are committed to continuously improving our security posture and adapting our policies and procedures to address emerging threats. All employees are responsible for adhering to this policy and contributing to the overall security of our organization. Any violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.
