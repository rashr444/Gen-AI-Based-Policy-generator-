## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using our information systems and data, regardless of location or device type. This policy is designed to comply with applicable regulations, including the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Although operating in a defined low-risk environment, this policy establishes a baseline security posture that will be continuously monitored and improved upon to address evolving threats.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Recognizing the inherent vulnerabilities in a healthcare environment, regular risk assessments are critical to maintaining a secure infrastructure.

-   --Frequency:-- Risk assessments will be conducted at least annually, and more frequently upon significant changes to the IT environment, business processes, or regulatory landscape.
-   --Scope:-- Assessments will cover all information systems, applications, and data storage locations that process, store, or transmit PHI and other sensitive data.
-   --Methodology:-- Risk assessments will follow a recognized methodology, such as that outlined in the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), focusing on identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential impact on the organization.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment findings, including identified risks, mitigation strategies, and remediation timelines, will be thoroughly documented and maintained.
-   --Low-Risk Tailoring:-- Given the organization's low-risk profile, risk assessments will focus on foundational controls and common attack vectors, emphasizing preventative measures and efficient incident response capabilities.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is paramount.

-   --Data Classification:-- All data will be classified based on sensitivity and criticality, with PHI and other sensitive information receiving the highest level of protection.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption will be implemented to protect data at rest (e.g., hard drives, databases) and in transit (e.g., email, file transfers). Encryption algorithms will adhere to industry-standard best practices and regulatory requirements.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- DLP measures will be implemented to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. These measures may include monitoring network traffic, restricting access to external storage devices, and implementing content filtering policies.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular data backups will be performed and stored securely in a geographically separate location. Recovery procedures will be documented and tested regularly to ensure timely data restoration in the event of a disaster or system failure.

### 4. Access Controls

Restricting access to sensitive data and systems is crucial.

-   --Least Privilege:-- Access to information systems and data will be granted on a need-to-know basis, following the principle of least privilege. Users will only have access to the resources necessary to perform their job duties.
-   --Strong Authentication:-- Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), will be implemented for all users accessing sensitive systems and data.
-   --Password Management:-- Strong password policies will be enforced, requiring users to create complex passwords that are changed regularly. Password reuse will be prohibited.
-   --Access Review:-- User access rights will be reviewed regularly, at least annually, to ensure that access is still appropriate and necessary.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), will be used to access the organization's network from remote locations. Remote access will be subject to the same security controls as on-site access.

### 5. Incident Response

A swift and effective response to security incidents is essential.

-   --Incident Response Plan (IRP):-- A comprehensive IRP will be developed and maintained, outlining the procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents. The IRP will be tested regularly through tabletop exercises and simulations.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All security incidents, or suspected security incidents, must be reported immediately to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Analysis:-- All reported incidents will be thoroughly analyzed to determine the root cause and identify any weaknesses in the organization's security posture.
-   --Lessons Learned:-- Following each incident, a lessons learned review will be conducted to identify opportunities for improvement and prevent future incidents.
-   --Communication:-- Clear communication channels will be established for reporting incidents and disseminating information to stakeholders.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

Educating users about security threats and best practices is critical.

-   --Training Frequency:-- All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter.
-   --Training Content:-- Training will cover topics such as phishing awareness, malware prevention, password security, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Phishing Simulations:-- Regular phishing simulations will be conducted to test users' ability to identify and report phishing attempts.
-   --Policy Reinforcement:-- Security awareness training will reinforce the requirements of this Cybersecurity Policy and other relevant security policies.
-   --Documentation:-- Records of security awareness training completion will be maintained.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

Continuous monitoring and auditing are necessary to ensure compliance.

-   --Compliance Framework:-- This Cybersecurity Policy is aligned with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and other applicable regulations.
-   --Internal Audits:-- Regular internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and other relevant security policies.
-   --External Audits:-- Periodic external audits will be conducted to validate the effectiveness of the organization's security controls and compliance with applicable regulations.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scanning will be performed on all information systems to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Periodic penetration testing will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the organization's security posture.
-   --Documentation:-- All audit findings, vulnerability scan results, and penetration test reports will be thoroughly documented and maintained. Remediation plans will be developed and implemented to address any identified weaknesses.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is a living document that will be reviewed and updated regularly to address evolving threats and regulatory requirements. All members of the organization are responsible for adhering to this policy and contributing to a secure healthcare environment. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. The CISO is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this Cybersecurity Policy.
