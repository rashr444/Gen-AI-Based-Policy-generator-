**Cybersecurity Policy for a Low-Risk Healthcare Environment**

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within [Organization Name], a healthcare provider operating in a relatively low-risk environment. As CISO, my priority is to ensure we deliver exceptional patient care by safeguarding the technology, data, and people that support our mission. This policy is designed to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and other applicable regulations. It applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals with access to [Organization Name]'s information systems and data. Understanding and adhering to this policy is crucial for maintaining a secure environment and protecting the trust of our patients. While our operational environment is classified as 'Low Risk', this does not imply a lack of vigilance, it signifies our proactive efforts in minimizing potential threats and ensuring operational resilience.

**2. Risk Assessment**

We conduct periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities. Given our low-risk environment, the following are considered major risk areas:

*   **Phishing Attacks:** *Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium.* Targeted phishing emails aimed at stealing credentials or deploying malware.
*   **Malware Infections:** *Likelihood: Low; Impact: Medium.* Introduction of viruses or other malicious software through infected files or websites.
*   **Insider Threats (Accidental):** *Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Low.* Unintentional data breaches or system disruptions caused by employee errors.
*   **Weak Passwords:** *Likelihood: Low; Impact: Medium.* Compromised accounts due to easily guessable passwords.
*   **Unpatched Systems:** *Likelihood: Low; Impact: Medium.* Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in outdated software.

These risks are assessed based on the organization's environment, data sensitivity, and the potential impact on patient care, operations, and compliance. Regular reviews will ensure that the risk assessment remains current and reflects any changes in the threat landscape.

**3. Data Protection**

*   **Data Classification:** All data is classified into the following categories:
    *   *Confidential:* Protected Health Information (PHI), financial data, and other sensitive information requiring strict access controls.
    *   *Internal:* Business-related information accessible to employees.
    *   *Public:* Information available to the general public.
*   **Data Handling:** Confidential data must be handled with utmost care. Physical documents must be stored securely, and electronic data must be encrypted.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encryption is required for all confidential data at rest (e.g., hard drives, databases) and in transit (e.g., email, file transfers). Approved encryption algorithms must be used.
*   **Data Retention:** Data will be retained according to established retention schedules, complying with regulatory requirements. Data that is no longer needed will be securely disposed of using approved methods.
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP tools and procedures will be implemented to monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data outside the organization.

**4. Access Controls**

*   **Authentication:** Strong passwords are required for all user accounts. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented where feasible, especially for access to sensitive systems and data.
*   **Authorization:** Access to systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will only have access to the resources necessary to perform their job duties.
*   **Account Management:** User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and terminated as employees join, change roles, or leave the organization. Regular reviews of user access rights will be conducted.
*   **Remote Access:** Secure remote access solutions, such as VPNs, will be used for accessing the network from outside the organization.

**5. Incident Response**

*   **Roles and Responsibilities:**
    *   *Incident Response Team (IRT):* Responsible for coordinating the response to security incidents. The IRT consists of representatives from IT, Security, Legal, and Communications.
    *   *All Employees:* Responsible for reporting suspected security incidents to the IT Help Desk or the Security Officer.
