## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Financial Environment

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy (the "Policy") outlines the minimum security requirements and guidelines for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data within this financial environment, designated as a Low-Risk environment. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities that access or use our information systems and data. This policy is designed to be consistent with the principles and practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF), tailored to the specific operational context and risk profile of a low-risk environment. While recognizing the inherent limitations of resources in a low-risk setting, this policy emphasizes preventative measures and diligent awareness to mitigate potential threats. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as necessitated by changes in the threat landscape, regulations, or business operations.

**2. Risk Assessment**

2.1. **Frequency:** Risk assessments, appropriate for a low-risk environment, will be conducted at least annually or upon significant changes to systems, applications, or the threat landscape.

2.2. **Scope:** Assessments will identify potential vulnerabilities and threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within the defined scope of the low-risk environment.

2.3. **Methodology:** The risk assessment process will employ a qualitative approach, focusing on identifying and categorizing potential risks based on their likelihood and impact. This will involve:

    *   Identifying assets within the scope of the low-risk environment (e.g., workstations, servers, network devices).
    *   Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   Assessing the likelihood of threat occurrence.
    *   Determining the potential impact should a threat materialize.

2.4. **Risk Prioritization:** Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Remediation efforts will focus on addressing the highest priority risks first.

2.5. **Documentation:** All risk assessment activities, findings, and remediation plans will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.

**3. Data Protection**

3.1. **Data Classification:** Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. In a low-risk environment, we will primarily focus on identifying and protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive financial data.

3.2. **Data Encryption:**  While full-disk encryption may not be mandatory for all systems in a low-risk environment, encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit is strongly recommended. Consideration should be given to encrypting removable media and laptops containing sensitive data.

3.3. **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regular data backups will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of data loss or system failure. Backups will be stored securely, both on-site and off-site, adhering to a defined retention schedule. Recovery procedures will be documented and tested periodically. Backup frequency will be determined by the criticality of the data being backed up.

3.4. **Data Disposal:**  Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed for business purposes, adhering to established data retention policies. Secure disposal methods include physical destruction of media and data wiping using approved software.

**4. Access Controls**

4.1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to information systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job duties.

4.2. **User Account Management:** User accounts will be created, modified, and terminated promptly upon hiring, role change, or termination of employment. Strong passwords are required for all user accounts.

4.3. **Authentication:** Strong authentication methods are encouraged. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for access to sensitive systems and data, especially for remote access.

4.4. **Access Review:** Access rights will be reviewed periodically (at least annually) to ensure that they remain appropriate and aligned with user roles and responsibilities.

4.5. **Remote Access:** Remote access to the organization's network and systems will be secured using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) or other secure remote access technologies. All remote access connections must adhere to the principle of least privilege.

**5. Incident Response**

5.1. **Incident Reporting:** All security incidents, suspected or confirmed, must be reported immediately to the designated incident response team or contact person.

5.2. **Incident Response Plan:**  A documented incident response plan will be maintained and tested periodically (at least annually). The plan will outline procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents. The plan should be scaled appropriately for a low-risk environment, focusing on clear communication channels and basic containment strategies.

5.3. **Incident Classification:** Incidents will be classified based on their severity and impact.

5.4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**  After each incident, a post-incident analysis will be conducted to identify the root cause of the incident and to implement measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

6.1. **Training Frequency:** All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive initial security awareness training upon hire and refresher training at least annually.

6.2. **Training Content:**  Security awareness training will cover topics such as:

    *   Common security threats (e.g., phishing, malware, social engineering)
    *   Data protection policies and procedures
    *   Password security best practices
    *   Incident reporting procedures
    *   Safe internet browsing habits
    *   Physical security awareness

6.3. **Training Delivery:** Training will be delivered through a variety of methods, including online modules, in-person presentations, and security awareness campaigns.

6.4. **Phishing Simulations:** Simulated phishing attacks may be conducted periodically to assess employee awareness and identify areas for improvement.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

7.1. **Policy Compliance:** All employees, contractors, and vendors are responsible for adhering to this Cybersecurity Policy.

7.2. **Internal Audits:** Internal audits will be conducted periodically (at least annually) to assess compliance with this policy and to identify any gaps in security controls.

7.3. **External Audits:** External audits may be conducted as required by regulatory bodies or industry standards.

7.4. **Policy Exceptions:**  Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the CISO or designated security authority.

7.5. **Reporting:**  Significant security incidents and compliance violations will be reported to senior management and relevant regulatory bodies as required.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of our overall risk management strategy. By adhering to the guidelines and procedures outlined in this policy, we can effectively protect our information assets, maintain the trust of our customers, and comply with applicable regulations. Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential to maintaining a strong security posture. All individuals covered by this policy are expected to understand their responsibilities and actively contribute to a secure environment. This policy is not exhaustive and should be interpreted in conjunction with other relevant policies and procedures.
