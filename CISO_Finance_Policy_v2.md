Okay, here's a comprehensive Cybersecurity Policy tailored for a low-risk Finance environment, adhering to PCI DSS compliance, and designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.  I've tried to balance comprehensiveness with clarity, acknowledging the "low risk" context while still maintaining the necessary rigor for the Finance industry.

--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Assessment Process:--

[Company Name] will conduct regular risk assessments to identify, analyze, and prioritize cybersecurity risks. These assessments will evaluate potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the likelihood and impact of security incidents.

--2.2 Risk Assessment Frequency:--

Risk assessments will be conducted at least annually, and whenever there are significant changes to the IT infrastructure, business processes, or regulatory requirements. Examples of significant changes include new software, new hardware, organizational restructuring, or changes in compliance requirements.

--2.3 Risk Treatment:--

Identified risks will be addressed through appropriate risk treatment strategies, including:

-   --Risk Avoidance:-- Eliminating the risk by discontinuing the activity or process.
-   --Risk Mitigation:-- Implementing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
-   --Risk Transfer:-- Transferring the risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing agreements.
-   --Risk Acceptance:-- Accepting the risk when the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential impact.
- --PCI DSS Specific Risk Assessment:-- The annual risk assessment will specifically address PCI DSS requirements and how those requirements are being met, including documentation and evidence of procedures.

--2.4 Documentation:--

All risk assessments, findings, and risk treatment plans will be documented and maintained by the [Designated Security Officer/Team].

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification:--

Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. Common data classifications include:

-   --Public:-- Information freely available to the public.
-   --Internal:-- Information intended for internal use only.
-   --Confidential:-- Sensitive information that requires protection from unauthorized access, such as customer data or financial records.
-   --Restricted:-- Highly sensitive information that requires the highest level of protection, such as passwords or encryption keys.

--3.2 Data Security Measures:--

Appropriate security measures will be implemented to protect data based on its classification. These measures may include:

-   --Encryption:-- Encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest.  All cardholder data must be encrypted according to PCI DSS standards.
-   --Access Controls:-- Limiting access to data based on the principle of least privilege (see Section 4).
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implementing DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control. (Note: may not be necessary in a -low- risk environment, but should be considered if sensitive data is frequently handled.)
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regularly backing up data and testing recovery procedures.
-   --Secure Disposal:-- Securely disposing of data when it is no longer needed.
-   --Tokenization or Masking:-- Masking or tokenizing cardholder data to reduce risk.

--3.3 Cardholder Data Protection (PCI DSS):--

[Company Name] will comply with all applicable PCI DSS requirements for protecting cardholder data. This includes:

-   Maintaining a secure network.

-   User accounts will be promptly disabled or terminated when employees leave the organization or change roles.

--4.2 Least Privilege:--

Access to systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Users will only be granted the access necessary to perform their job duties.

--4.3 Access Control Lists (ACLs):--

Access control lists will be used to restrict access to files, directories, and other resources.

--4.4 Physical Security:--

Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled through measures such as key cards, biometric scanners, or security guards.
