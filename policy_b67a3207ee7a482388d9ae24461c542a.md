## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the standards and procedures for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our organization. It is designed to protect our information assets from both internal and external threats, aligned with industry best practices and applicable compliance standards, including SOC 2. Although our organization operates in a low-risk environment, proactive security measures are vital to minimizing potential disruptions and safeguarding patient data. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using our systems, networks, and data. All personnel are expected to understand and adhere to this policy.

### 2. Risk Assessment

We will conduct an annual risk assessment to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. This assessment will consider:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identification of critical information assets, including hardware, software, data, and personnel.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identification of potential threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Evaluation of weaknesses in our systems and processes that could be exploited by identified threats.
-   --Impact Analysis:-- Determination of the potential business impact if a threat were to successfully exploit a vulnerability, considering financial, reputational, and operational consequences.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritization of identified risks based on their likelihood and potential impact.

The results of the risk assessment will be used to inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls and to update this policy as needed. The risk assessment will be documented and reviewed by senior management.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data, especially PHI, is paramount. The following data protection measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI and other sensitive data stored at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control without authorization. This includes monitoring network traffic, email communications, and removable media usage.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely in a separate location. Recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner in the event of a disaster or data loss event.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements. Data will be securely disposed of using approved methods to prevent unauthorized access.
-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality, and appropriate security controls will be applied accordingly.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to systems, networks, and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users will only be granted access to the information and resources necessary to perform their job duties. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Account Management:-- User accounts will be created, modified, and terminated promptly when individuals join, change roles, or leave the organization.
-   --Strong Authentication:-- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for all users accessing sensitive systems and data remotely, as well as for privileged accounts.
-   --Password Management:-- Strong password policies will be enforced, requiring users to create complex passwords and change them regularly. Password reuse will be prohibited.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access privileges will be assigned based on roles and responsibilities.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:-- Periodic reviews of user access rights will be conducted to ensure that access privileges remain appropriate and are not excessive.

### 5. Incident Response

A comprehensive Incident Response Plan (IRP) will be maintained and regularly tested to ensure a coordinated and effective response to security incidents. The IRP will outline procedures for:

-   --Incident Detection and Reporting:-- All employees are responsible for promptly reporting suspected security incidents to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Procedures for containing security incidents to prevent further damage or data loss.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Procedures for removing the cause of the incident and restoring affected systems and data.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures for restoring normal operations and verifying that systems are functioning correctly.
-   --Post-Incident Analysis:-- Analysis of security incidents to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Communication:-- Procedures for communicating with stakeholders, including employees, patients, and regulatory agencies, as appropriate.

The IRP will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices. Training will cover topics such as:

-   --Phishing Awareness:-- How to identify and avoid phishing attacks.
-   --Malware Prevention:-- How to protect against malware infections.
-   --Password Security:-- Best practices for creating and managing strong passwords.
-   --Data Protection:-- How to handle sensitive data securely.
-   --Social Engineering:-- How to recognize and avoid social engineering attacks.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- How to report suspected security incidents.
-   --Policy Compliance:-- Understanding and adhering to this Cybersecurity Policy.

Training will be provided upon hire and annually thereafter. Refresher training will be provided as needed to address emerging threats.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including SOC 2. To ensure compliance, the following measures will be implemented:

-   --Regular Audits:-- Periodic internal and external audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of our security controls and compliance with applicable requirements.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:-- Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests will be performed to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
-   --Policy Review and Updates:-- This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and business operations.
-   --Documentation:-- All security policies, procedures, and controls will be documented and maintained in a central repository.
-   --Third-Party Risk Management:-- Conduct due diligence on third-party vendors who have access to our data to ensure that they have adequate security controls in place.

The results of audits and assessments will be reported to senior management and used to improve our security posture.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of our overall risk management strategy. By adhering to the principles and procedures outlined in this policy, we can effectively protect our information assets, maintain the trust of our patients and stakeholders, and ensure the continued success of our organization. All employees, contractors, and vendors are expected to fully comply with this policy. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy will be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure it remains relevant and effective in addressing evolving cybersecurity threats.
