## Cybersecurity Policy for a Low-Risk Financial Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for all information systems and data within [Organization Name], a financial institution operating in a low-risk environment. This policy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our assets while adhering to relevant compliance standards, specifically the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing, processing, or storing organizational data. A low-risk environment, in this context, implies that the organization's systems and data are not subject to high-value transactions or sensitive customer information that would typically be targeted by sophisticated threat actors. However, a foundational level of cybersecurity is still critical to prevent basic attacks and ensure business continuity.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] will conduct periodic risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems. These assessments will:

-   Identify critical assets and data.
-   Identify potential threats (e.g., malware, phishing, data breaches, insider threats).
-   Identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and processes.
-   Assess the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact on the organization.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce identified risks.

Risk assessments will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur in the threat landscape, business operations, or technology infrastructure.

### 3. Data Protection

Data protection is paramount. [Organization Name] will implement the following measures to protect data:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality (e.g., public, internal, confidential).
-   --Data Encryption:-- Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular data backups will be performed and stored in a secure offsite location. Recovery procedures will be tested regularly to ensure timely restoration of data in case of a disaster or data loss event.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- DLP measures will be implemented to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control.
-   --Data Retention:-- Data will be retained according to legal and regulatory requirements and business needs.
-   --Data Destruction:-- When data is no longer needed, it will be securely destroyed using approved methods.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to information systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. This means that users will only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties. Access control measures include:

-   --User Authentication:-- All users will be required to authenticate their identity before accessing systems and data. Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), will be used where feasible and appropriate.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access permissions will be assigned based on user roles and responsibilities.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:-- User access privileges will be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain appropriate.
-   --Password Management:-- Users will be required to create strong passwords that meet specific complexity requirements and change their passwords regularly. Password reuse will be prohibited.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted and monitored.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] will maintain an incident response plan to effectively manage and respond to security incidents. The incident response plan will include:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Steps to contain and isolate the impact of a security incident.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Actions to remove the cause of the security incident.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures to restore systems and data to their normal state.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- Post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned and improve security measures.

All employees will be trained on how to identify and report security incidents. Security incidents will be reported to the designated incident response team immediately.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive regular security awareness training to educate them about cybersecurity threats and best practices. Training topics will include:

-   Phishing awareness
-   Malware prevention
-   Password security
-   Data protection
-   Incident reporting
-   Social engineering

Security awareness training will be provided upon hire and annually thereafter.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including the Risk Management Framework (RMF). We will:

-   Implement and maintain controls based on RMF guidelines.
-   Conduct regular internal audits to assess compliance with this policy and other security requirements.
-   Cooperate fully with external audits and inspections.
-   Maintain documentation to demonstrate compliance with applicable requirements.
-   Address any identified compliance gaps promptly and effectively.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting [Organization Name]'s information assets and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. All personnel are responsible for adhering to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed to address changes in the threat landscape, business operations, or technology infrastructure. The [Designated Security Officer/Team] is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this policy.
