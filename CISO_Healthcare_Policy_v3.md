Okay, here's a comprehensive cybersecurity policy tailored for a low-risk healthcare environment, designed to be HIPAA compliant, addressing the specific weaknesses identified in your feedback, and formatted for diverse audiences:

--Cybersecurity Policy--

--1. Introduction--

-   --Purpose:-- This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the standards and procedures that [Organization Name] (hereafter "the Organization") will adhere to in order to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy ensures compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and relevant state and federal regulations.
-   --Scope:-- This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, and any other individuals or entities that access, use, or manage the Organization's information systems, networks, and data, regardless of location or device used. This includes all devices used to access, store, or transmit ePHI, including but not limited to desktop computers, laptops, mobile devices, and cloud services.
-   --Policy Objectives:--
    -   Protect PHI and sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
    -   Maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and networks.
    -   Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including HIPAA.
    -   Establish a framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
    -   Promote a culture of security awareness and responsibility among all personnel.
-   --Policy Ownership and Review:--  The [Job Title - e.g., HIPAA Security Officer] is responsible for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of this policy. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in technology, regulations, or business operations.

--2. Risk Assessment--

-   --Purpose:--  To systematically identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to the Organization's information assets, and to prioritize and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks.
-   --Methodology:-- The Organization will conduct periodic risk assessments, at least annually, using a methodology consistent with industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).  The CSF provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk and improving organizational resilience. Specific risk assessment steps include:
    -   --Asset Identification:-- Identify all critical assets that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. This includes hardware, software, data, and personnel.
    -   --Threat Identification:-- Identify potential threats to the organization's ePHI, such as malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and physical security breaches.
    -   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identify weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats. Vulnerability scans will be conducted at least quarterly, and patch management processes will be implemented to address identified vulnerabilities promptly.
    -   --Impact Analysis:-- Evaluate the potential impact to the organization if a threat were to exploit a vulnerability. This includes the financial, operational, and reputational impact.
    -   --Likelihood Assessment:-- Assess the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability.
    -   --Risk Scoring:-- Assign a risk score to each identified risk based on the likelihood and impact.
    -   --Control Recommendations:-- Develop and implement security controls to mitigate the identified risks based on the risk score.
-   --Documentation:--  All risk assessment activities, findings, and mitigation plans will be documented and maintained for audit purposes.
-   --Remediation Planning:-- A risk remediation plan will be developed and implemented based on the risk assessment findings. The plan will include specific actions, responsible parties, and target completion dates.

--3. Data Protection--

-   --Purpose:-- To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI and other sensitive data.
-   --Data Encryption:--
    -   --Encryption at Rest:--  All ePHI stored on Organization-owned devices (desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers) and in cloud storage environments will be encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption or equivalent.  Specific technologies utilized include [Specify technology - e.g., BitLocker, VeraCrypt, server-side encryption in AWS S3].
    -   --Encryption in Transit:-- All ePHI transmitted over networks, including the internet, will be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher.  This includes email, web traffic, and file transfers. Specific technologies utilized include [Specify technology - e.g., HTTPS, VPN with AES encryption, secure email gateways].
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:--
    -   Regular backups of all critical data, including ePHI, will be performed at least [Frequency - e.g., daily] and stored in a secure, offsite location.
    -   Backup data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    -   Regular testing of the backup and recovery process will be conducted to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.  A recovery time objective (RTO) of [Specify RTO - e.g., 4 hours] and a recovery point objective (RPO) of [Specify RPO - e.g., 1 hour] will be maintained.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--
    -   The Organization will implement DLP measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of ePHI. This includes [Specific DLP measures - e.g., monitoring data in motion and at rest, blocking the transfer of sensitive data to unauthorized locations, educating employees on proper data handling procedures].
-   --Data Minimization:-- The Organization will only collect and retain ePHI that is necessary for legitimate business purposes.  Data retention policies will be established and followed to ensure that data is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed.
-   --Data Sanitization:--  When disposing of electronic devices that contain ePHI, the data will be securely wiped using a method that meets or exceeds NIST 800-88 guidelines.  Physical destruction of storage media will be performed when wiping is not feasible.

--4. Access Controls--

-   --Purpose:--  To restrict access to ePHI and information systems to authorized individuals only.
-   --User Authentication:--
    -   Strong passwords will be required for all user accounts.  Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and must be changed at least every 90 days.
