--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Assessment Process:--
[Organization Name] will conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and data. The risk assessment process will include:

-   --Identification of Assets:--  Identifying all information assets, including hardware, software, data, and physical locations.
-   --Threat Identification:--  Identifying potential threats to these assets, such as malware, phishing, unauthorized access, and natural disasters.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:--  Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, and processes that could be exploited by threats.
-   --Impact Analysis:--  Determining the potential impact to the organization if a threat were to successfully exploit a vulnerability, including financial, reputational, and legal consequences.
-   --Likelihood Assessment:--  Assessing the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
-   --Risk Prioritization:--  Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.

--2.2 Frequency:--
Risk assessments will be conducted at least annually and whenever there are significant changes to the organization's IT infrastructure, business processes, or regulatory environment.

--2.3 Documentation:--
All risk assessments will be documented, including the methodology used, the findings, and the recommendations for mitigation.

--2.4 Risk Mitigation:--
Identified risks will be addressed through appropriate mitigation strategies, which may include:

-   Implementing technical controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption).
-   Implementing administrative controls (e.g., policies, procedures, training).
-   Transferring risk (e.g., cybersecurity insurance).
-   Accepting risk (with appropriate justification and documentation).

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification:--
All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  The following classification levels will be used:

-   --Restricted:--  Data that requires the highest level of protection due to legal or regulatory requirements (e.g., PHI, financial data, social security numbers).
-   --Confidential:--  Data that is sensitive and should only be accessed by authorized personnel (e.g., internal business plans, employee records).
-   --Internal:--  Data that is intended for internal use only (e.g., internal memos, procedural documentation).
-   --Public:--  Data that is publicly available (e.g., marketing materials, website content).

--3.2 Data Encryption:--
All restricted data, especially ePHI, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

-   --In Transit:-- Encryption protocols such as TLS/SSL will be used for data transmitted over networks, including email and web traffic.
-   --At Rest:-- Encryption will be used for data stored on servers, laptops, desktops, and mobile devices.

--3.3 Data Backup and Recovery:--
Regular backups of all critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or disaster.

-   Backup data will be stored in a secure, offsite location.
-   Backup procedures will be tested regularly to ensure that data can be restored successfully.

--3.4 Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--
Measures will be taken to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

-   DLP tools may be used to monitor and control data leaving the organization's network.
-   Policies will be implemented to prevent employees from storing sensitive data on personal devices or sharing it through unauthorized channels.

--3.5 Data Retention and Disposal:--
Data will be retained according to legal and regulatory requirements and the organization's data retention policy. When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using methods that prevent unauthorized access or recovery (e.g., data wiping, physical destruction).

--4. Access Controls--

--4.1 User Authentication:--
All users must be authenticated before being granted access to organizational systems and data.

-   --Strong Passwords:--  Users will be required to create strong passwords that meet minimum complexity requirements (e.g., length, character diversity).
-   --Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):--  MFA will be implemented for all users accessing sensitive systems and data, whenever technically feasible.
-   --Unique User IDs:-- Each user will have a unique user ID and password.

--4.2 Access Authorization:--
Access to systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that users will only be granted the minimum access necessary to perform their job duties.

-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access rights will be assigned based on user roles and responsibilities.
-   --Access Reviews:--  Access rights will be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are still appropriate.
-   --Termination of Access:-- Access rights will be promptly revoked when an employee leaves the organization or changes roles.
