-   Clearly outline consequences for non-compliance with this policy.

--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Management Framework (RMF)--

The Organization adopts the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) as its foundational approach to cybersecurity risk management. The RMF provides a structured and comprehensive process for:

-   --Categorizing:-- Identifying the information systems and data based on criticality and sensitivity, assigning impact levels according to FIPS 199.
-   --Selecting:-- Choosing a baseline set of security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53, tailored to the Organization's risk profile and compliance requirements.
-   --Implementing:-- Deploying and configuring the selected security controls.
-   --Assessing:-- Evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.
-   --Authorizing:-- Determining whether the residual risk is acceptable and authorizing the operation of the information system.
-   --Monitoring:-- Continuously monitoring the security controls and the risk environment to identify and address any changes or vulnerabilities.

--2.2 Risk Assessment Process--

A formal risk assessment will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities. The risk assessment process will include:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying all critical assets, including hardware, software, data, and personnel.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities.
-   --Vulnerability Identification:-- Identifying weaknesses in systems, applications, or processes that could be exploited.
-   --Likelihood Assessment:-- Estimating the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
-   --Impact Assessment:-- Determining the potential impact of a successful exploit.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and impact.
-   --Risk Mitigation:-- Identifying and implementing appropriate security controls to mitigate identified risks.

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification--

All data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality.  At a minimum, the following classification levels will be used:

-   --Restricted:-- Data requiring the highest level of protection, including PHI, confidential financial information, and trade secrets. Access to Restricted data is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel.
-   --Confidential:-- Data that is sensitive but not as critical as Restricted data.  Unauthorized disclosure could have a negative impact on the Organization.
-   --Public:-- Data that is not sensitive and can be freely disclosed.

--3.2 Data Encryption--

-   All PHI and other sensitive data stored on laptops, portable devices, and removable media must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
-   Encryption should be utilized for data in transit across public networks (e.g., email, file transfers).
-   Data at rest in databases and servers should also be encrypted where technically feasible and based on risk assessment.

--3.3 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)--

The Organization will implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Organization's control without authorization. This includes:

-   Monitoring network traffic for sensitive data transmissions.
-   Implementing policies and procedures to prevent the unauthorized copying or sharing of sensitive data.
-   Using DLP tools to detect and block unauthorized data transfers.

--3.4 Data Backup and Recovery--

Regular backups of all critical data will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backup procedures will include:

-   Performing full backups on a regular schedule.
-   Performing incremental or differential backups to capture changes since the last full backup.
-   Storing backups in a secure, offsite location.
-   Regularly testing backup and recovery procedures to ensure their effectiveness.

--3.5 Physical Security--

The organization's physical locations need to maintain physical security in order to restrict access to authorized personnel to prevent damage or theft of sensitive data or systems.
