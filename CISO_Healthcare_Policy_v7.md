--2. Risk Assessment--

--2.1 Risk Management Process:-- The Organization will conduct regular risk assessments, at least annually, to identify, analyze, and evaluate cybersecurity risks. The risk assessment process will include:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying all critical information assets, including hardware, software, data, and personnel.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in the Organization's systems and data.  Examples include malware, phishing, ransomware, and insider threats.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Identifying weaknesses in the Organization's systems, networks, and processes. This may include penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security audits.
-   --Impact Assessment:-- Evaluating the potential impact of a successful cyberattack on the Organization's operations, reputation, and compliance.
-   --Likelihood Assessment:-- Evaluating the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritizing risks based on their potential impact and likelihood.

--2.2 Mitigation Strategies:-- Based on the risk assessment, the Organization will implement appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the identified risks. These strategies may include:

-   Implementing technical controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware software.
-   Developing and implementing security policies and procedures.
-   Providing security awareness training to employees.
-   Implementing incident response plans.
-   Purchasing cyber insurance.

--2.3 NIST Alignment:--  The risk assessment process will align with NIST CSF ID.RA-1: Assets are identified and managed.  Specifically, the risk assessment will consider NIST Special Publication 800-30, "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments," for guidance on performing risk assessments.

--3. Data Protection--

--3.1 Data Classification:-- All data created, processed, stored, or transmitted by the Organization will be classified according to its sensitivity and criticality. Data classifications will include:

-   --Confidential:-- Data that, if disclosed without authorization, could cause significant harm to the Organization, its patients, or employees (e.g., PHI, financial records).
-   --Private:-- Data that should only be accessible to authorized personnel within the organization.
-   --Internal:-- Data that is intended for internal use only and is not generally available to the public.
-   --Public:-- Data that is publicly available and does not require protection.

--3.2 Data Encryption:-- Confidential data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.  Encryption keys will be managed securely. Data classification will dictate the level of encryption required.

-   --In Transit:--  All data transmitted over public networks, including the internet, will be encrypted using strong encryption protocols, such as TLS 1.2 or higher.
-   --At Rest:--  Confidential data stored on hard drives, servers, and other storage devices will be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256.

--3.3 Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--  The Organization will implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Organization's control.  This may include:

-   Monitoring network traffic for unauthorized data transfers.
-   Blocking access to unauthorized websites and applications.
-   Implementing controls to prevent data from being copied to removable media.
-   Implementing data masking techniques to protect sensitive data in non-production environments.

--3.4 Data Backup and Recovery:--  The Organization will maintain regular backups of all critical data.  Backups will be stored offsite in a secure location.  The Organization will test its backup and recovery procedures regularly to ensure that data can be restored in a timely manner.

--3.5 NIST Alignment:-- Data protection measures align with NIST CSF PR.DS-1: Data-at-rest is protected, and PR.DS-2: Data-in-transit is protected. Encryption standards and key management will adhere to guidelines found in NIST Special Publication 800-57, "Recommendation for Key Management."
