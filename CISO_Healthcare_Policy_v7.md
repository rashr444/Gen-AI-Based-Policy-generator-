## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data within our healthcare organization. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, acknowledging limited resources and infrastructure, and is aligned with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). All employees, contractors, volunteers, and other individuals affiliated with the organization are required to adhere to this policy. Its purpose is to minimize the risk of data breaches, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and maintain the trust of our patients and stakeholders. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or organizational practices.  All policy revisions will be communicated to relevant personnel.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Given the low-risk environment, our risk assessment process will focus on identifying common vulnerabilities and implementing proportionate controls. This includes:

-   --Annual Risk Assessment:-- A comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted annually, utilizing a simplified version of the --NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)-- to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to our systems and data. The assessment will consider factors such as the type of data stored, the systems used to process data, and the potential impact of a data breach. The initial assessment will establish a baseline, and subsequent assessments will measure progress against that baseline.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans of our systems will be performed to identify and address potential security weaknesses. This will include --network vulnerability scans using open-source tools like OpenVAS and Nessus Essentials-- to identify exposed ports and known vulnerabilities in our network infrastructure. We will also conduct --basic web application scans using OWASP ZAP-- on any web-based applications we host to identify common web vulnerabilities. These scans will be conducted at least quarterly, or more frequently as needed based on the criticality of the system and the frequency of software updates.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Identified risks will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence using a --simple three-tier risk scoring system (High, Medium, Low)--. This system will consider factors such as data sensitivity, system criticality, and the potential financial and reputational damage resulting from a breach.  High-risk vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days, medium-risk vulnerabilities within 90 days, and low-risk vulnerabilities will be tracked and addressed as resources allow.
-   --Documentation:-- All risk assessment activities, including the identification of risks, prioritization, and remediation efforts, will be thoroughly documented in a risk register. The risk register will include a description of the risk, its potential impact, its likelihood of occurrence, its risk score, the planned remediation steps, and the date the remediation was completed.

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive data is paramount. Our data protection measures include:

-   --Data Minimization:-- We will collect and retain only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide services and comply with legal requirements. Data retention schedules will be defined and enforced.
-   --Data Encryption:-- PHI and other sensitive data will be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes encrypting data stored on laptops, mobile devices, and servers, as well as data transmitted over networks. For data at rest, we will utilize --AES 256-bit encryption-- for hard drives and databases. For data in transit, we will enforce --TLS 1.2 or higher-- for all network communication.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of all critical data will be performed to ensure data availability in the event of a system failure or disaster. Backups will be stored in a secure location, separate from the primary systems (e.g., cloud backup service or offsite storage facility). Backup and recovery procedures will be tested at least annually to ensure their effectiveness.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Data will be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed. This includes securely wiping hard drives using a secure wiping utility (e.g., DBAN), shredding paper documents using a cross-cut shredder, and securely destroying electronic media. A certificate of destruction will be obtained for all media disposed of by a third-party vendor.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to PHI and other sensitive data will be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access.

-   --Principle of Least Privilege:-- Users will be granted access only to the data and systems they need to perform their job duties.
-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for all user accounts. Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and be changed every 90 days.
-   --Access Revocation:-- Access to systems and data will be promptly revoked within 24 hours when an employee leaves the organization or changes roles.  A documented offboarding procedure will be followed to ensure all access is terminated.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access rights will be assigned based on user roles, ensuring that users have only the necessary permissions. Role definitions will be documented and reviewed annually.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to facilities and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel through the use of keycards or other access control systems.  Access logs will be reviewed regularly.
-   --Privileged Access Management (PAM):--  Administrative accounts will be managed through a PAM solution (even a basic one implemented using a password vault and strict password policies) to control and monitor privileged access.
-   --Regular Access Reviews:--  User access rights will be reviewed at least annually by department heads to ensure that users still require the access they have been granted.

### 5. Incident Response

A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for handling security incidents effectively.

-   --Incident Response Plan:-- A detailed incident response plan will be developed and maintained. The plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review. The plan will be tested at least annually through tabletop exercises.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- All employees are required to report suspected security incidents immediately to the designated incident response team (designated contact person with backup). The reporting mechanism (e.g., email address, phone number) will be clearly communicated to all employees.
-   --Incident Analysis:-- All reported incidents will be thoroughly investigated to determine the cause and impact of the incident.  The incident analysis will include documenting the timeline of events, identifying affected systems and data, and assessing the potential damage.
-   --Containment and Eradication:-- Measures will be taken to contain and eradicate security incidents as quickly as possible to minimize the impact. This may include isolating affected systems, patching vulnerabilities, and removing malicious software.
-   --Recovery:-- Systems and data will be recovered to their normal state after a security incident.
-   --Post-Incident Review:-- A post-incident review will be conducted after each incident to identify lessons learned and improve the incident response process.  The review will focus on identifying areas where the incident response plan can be improved and implementing corrective actions.
-   --Roles and Responsibilities:-- The Incident Response Plan will clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member, including a Incident Commander, a Communications Officer, and a Technical Lead.
-   --Communication Protocols:-- Internal and external communication protocols will be outlined in the Incident Response Plan, including contact information for key stakeholders and law enforcement agencies.
-   --Escalation Procedures:-- The Incident Response Plan will define clear escalation procedures for escalating incidents to higher levels of management or external authorities, depending on the severity of the incident.
-   --Legal/Regulatory Notification Requirements:-- The Incident Response Plan will address legal and regulatory notification requirements, including data breach notification laws and HIPAA requirements.
-    --Forensic Data Preservation:-- All incident response procedures will include steps to preserve forensic data to maintain chain of custody and ensure admissibility in legal proceedings.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

Security awareness training is essential for educating employees about cybersecurity risks and best practices.

-   --Annual Training:-- All employees will receive annual security awareness training that covers topics such as phishing, malware, password security, data protection, and social engineering.
