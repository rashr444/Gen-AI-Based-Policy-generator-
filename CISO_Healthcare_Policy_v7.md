## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum security standards required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data within this organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using our information systems, regardless of location. This policy is designed to align with applicable regulations, including those relevant to ISO/IEC 27001, and to ensure responsible and ethical management of information security risks. This policy recognizes that we operate in a low-risk environment, and therefore implements security controls that are appropriate and proportionate to the identified risks. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for the implementation and maintenance of this policy.

--2. Risk Assessment--

A risk assessment will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur to the organization's systems, infrastructure, or operations. This assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential security incidents, and determine appropriate security controls. Given our designation as a "low-risk" environment, the assessment will focus on common, readily addressed threats, and prioritize mitigation strategies that are cost-effective and operationally efficient. The risk assessment methodology will be documented and consistently applied. Specific attention will be paid to:

-   --Data Breaches:-- Unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or theft of ePHI.
-   --Malware Infections:-- Viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software that can compromise systems and data.
-   --Phishing Attacks:-- Deceptive emails or websites designed to steal credentials or sensitive information.
-   --Insider Threats:-- Intentional or unintentional misuse of data by authorized personnel.
-   --Physical Security:-- Unauthorized access to facilities and IT equipment.

--3. Data Protection--

All ePHI and other sensitive data must be protected in accordance with applicable regulations and industry best practices.

-   --Data Encryption:-- Data at rest (e.g., stored on hard drives, databases, and backup tapes) will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Data in transit (e.g., transmitted over networks) will be encrypted using secure protocols such as HTTPS and VPNs.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored securely in an off-site location. Backup and recovery procedures will be tested periodically to ensure data can be restored in a timely manner.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only the minimum necessary data required for business operations should be collected, stored, and processed.
-   --Data Disposal:-- Data should be securely disposed of when it is no longer needed, using methods that prevent unauthorized access to the data.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.

-   --User Authentication:-- All users must be authenticated using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication. Default passwords must be changed immediately upon initial login. Password complexity and expiration policies will be enforced.
-   --Authorization:-- User access rights will be reviewed regularly to ensure that users only have access to the data and systems they need to perform their job duties.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network will be secured using VPNs and multi-factor authentication. Remote access privileges will be regularly reviewed and revoked when no longer needed.
-   --Physical Access:-- Physical access to data centers and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel. Access control systems, such as keycards or biometrics, will be used to control access.

--5. Incident Response--

A documented incident response plan will be maintained and tested regularly. The plan will outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and reporting.

-   --Incident Reporting:-- All suspected security incidents must be reported immediately to the designated incident response team.
-   --Incident Investigation:-- All reported incidents will be investigated to determine the cause, scope, and impact of the incident.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Steps will be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- The root cause of the incident will be identified and removed.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Systems and data will be restored to normal operation.
-   --Post-Incident Review:-- A post-incident review will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve the incident response plan.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training on a regular basis. The training will cover topics such as:

-   --Phishing awareness:-- Recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   --Password security:-- Creating and maintaining strong passwords.
-   --Data protection:-- Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
-   --Incident reporting:-- Reporting suspected security incidents.
-   --Social engineering:-- Recognizing and avoiding social engineering attacks.
-   --Acceptable use:-- Adhering to the organization's acceptable use policy.

Training frequency will be determined based on risk assessments, but will typically occur at least annually, and upon onboarding. Refresher training will be provided periodically.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if necessary, to ensure it remains aligned with applicable regulations, industry best practices, and the organization's risk profile.

-   --Policy Enforcement:-- This policy will be enforced through a combination of technical controls, administrative procedures, and disciplinary actions.
-   --Internal Audits:-- Regular internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy.
-   --External Audits:-- External audits may be conducted by third-party auditors to assess compliance with applicable regulations and standards such as ISO/IEC 27001.
-   --Documentation:-- All security-related activities, including risk assessments, incident responses, and audit findings, will be documented.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI and other sensitive data within this organization. All employees, contractors, and vendors are responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. The CISO is responsible for overseeing the implementation and enforcement of this policy and for ensuring that the organization's cybersecurity posture remains strong and resilient. This policy will be continuously improved based on evolving threats, vulnerabilities, and regulatory requirements.
