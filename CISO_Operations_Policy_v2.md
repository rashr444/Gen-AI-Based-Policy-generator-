## Cybersecurity Policy for Operations - Low Risk Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the standards and procedures implemented to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within our Operations environment. This policy is designed to address the specific risks associated with our industry while acknowledging the assessment of a "Low Risk" operating environment. All employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals with access to our systems and data are expected to adhere to this policy. This policy supports our commitment to responsible data handling and compliance with applicable regulations, including the DDRO compliance standard.  This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently in response to significant changes in the threat landscape, business operations, or regulatory requirements.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Due to the identified "Low Risk" environment, we will conduct risk assessments on an annual basis, or more frequently if significant changes occur in our operational environment, threat landscape, or regulatory requirements. These assessments will identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on our business operations. While the overall risk is deemed low, the assessments will still consider factors such as:

-   --Data Sensitivity:-- Identifying the classification of data handled (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).  Specific classifications will be defined in a Data Classification Standard.
-   --System Criticality:-- Determining the importance of IT systems to business operations (e.g., mission-critical, business-critical, support systems). This assessment will consider the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each system.
-   --Threat Landscape:-- Monitoring for emerging threats relevant to our industry and business profile, using sources such as industry-specific threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability databases (e.g., NIST National Vulnerability Database).
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regularly scanning systems for known vulnerabilities using automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus Essentials) and penetration testing, at least annually.

The risk assessment findings will be documented in a Risk Register, which will include identified risks, their likelihood and impact, proposed mitigation strategies, and assigned owners. This register will be reviewed and updated regularly.

### 3. Data Protection

Despite operating in a low risk environment, data protection is paramount. The following measures are in place:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on sensitivity and business value according to the Data Classification Standard. Examples include:
    -   -Public:- Information freely available to anyone.
    -   -Internal:- Information for internal use only.
    -   -Confidential:- Information requiring protection due to legal or competitive reasons.
    -   -Restricted:- Highly sensitive information requiring the highest level of protection.

    --DDRO Alignment:-- This section directly addresses DDRO requirements related to data handling and classification, specifically [Insert specific DDRO clause number related to data classification].

-   --Data Storage:-- Data will be stored securely using appropriate physical and logical controls, including encryption where deemed necessary based on data classification. For example:

### 5. Incident Response

Even in a low risk environment, it is crucial to have procedures in place to effectively manage security incidents. An Incident Response Plan (IRP) will be maintained, regularly reviewed (at least annually), and tested (tabletop exercises annually) to ensure its effectiveness. The IRP will be a separate document that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident, including:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting potential security incidents. This includes establishing a dedicated email address (security@example.com) and a hotline for reporting incidents. All employees are responsible for reporting suspected security incidents immediately.

    -   -Training:- As detailed in Section 6, we provide security awareness training to our employees to ensure they understand their responsibilities for protecting information. [Insert specific DDRO clause number(s)].

-   --Internal Audits:-- Regular internal audits will be conducted at least annually to assess the effectiveness of our security controls and compliance with this policy and relevant regulations. Audit findings will be documented and tracked to remediation.

-   --External Audits:-- Periodic external audits may be conducted to provide independent assurance of our security posture and compliance with applicable standards.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is a critical component of our overall risk management strategy. While our environment is categorized as "Low Risk," adherence to this policy is essential to protect our information assets and maintain the trust of our stakeholders. This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective in addressing evolving threats and regulatory requirements. The CISO (or designated Security Officer) is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this policy, with support from all employees and stakeholders.  Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the CISO.

Key improvements and explanations:

-   --More Specific Examples:-- Added examples of encryption standards (AES-256, TLS 1.3), data wiping tools (DBAN), vulnerability scanners (Nessus), and remote access methods (VPN with MFA).
-   --Concrete Procedures:-- Expanded on data disposal methods, backup procedures (including retention policy), and account management practices.
-   --Incident Response Detail:-- While maintaining the reference to a separate IRP, the policy now includes a high-level overview of the key components -within- the policy itself.
-   --DDRO Mapping:--  The most significant change is the explicit mapping of policy sections to specific DDRO requirements.  Crucially, the instructions now include placeholders: `[Insert specific DDRO clause number(s)]`.  --You MUST replace these placeholders with the -actual- DDRO clause numbers that each section addresses.-- This is -essential- for demonstrating actual compliance.  I have aligned specific sections of the policy that are addressing requirements to the corresponding areas of DDRO (data handling, access controls, incident reporting and training)
-   --Policy Review:--  Added frequency and reasons for policy review.
-   --Exception Handling:--  Added requirement for documented and approved exceptions.
-   --Added Specificity:-- Added more specific data types that are classified.
-   --Clarity and Readability:-- Enhanced the language for better clarity and understanding.

--Important Considerations:--

-   --DDRO Clause Numbers:--  --The placeholders for DDRO clause numbers -must- be replaced with the actual numbers from the DDRO standard.-- This is the most critical step in making this policy truly compliant.  You will need to consult the DDRO documentation to find the relevant clauses.
-   --Tailoring:--  This is still a general template. You need to tailor it to your specific organization, systems, data, and risk profile.
-   --Supporting Documentation:-- This policy will likely require supporting documentation, such as:
    -   Data Classification Standard
    -   Incident Response Plan
    -   Account Management Procedure
    -   Data Disposal Procedure
    -   Risk Register
-   --Legal Review:-- It is strongly recommended to have this policy reviewed by legal counsel to ensure it complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
-   --Enforcement:-- Having a policy is not enough. You must enforce it consistently and fairly.
-   --Low Risk Justification:-- Ensure the "Low Risk" assessment is properly documented and justifiable. The regulators may challenge this assessment if the controls are weak or if there is evidence of significant risk.  Document -why- it's considered low risk.
-   --CISO or Designated Security Officer:-- Clearly identify the role responsible for the enforcement of this policy.

By addressing the weaknesses identified and adding the necessary specifics and DDRO mapping, this revised Cybersecurity Policy should be a significantly more robust and effective document. Remember to fill in the DDRO clause numbers and tailor the policy to your organization's unique context.
