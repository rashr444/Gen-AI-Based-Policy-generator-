## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Healthcare Environment

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security standards necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) and other sensitive data held by [Organization Name]. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, acknowledging limited resources and focusing on fundamental cybersecurity controls. All employees, contractors, vendors, and other individuals or entities accessing or using [Organization Name]'s systems and data must adhere to this policy. The objectives of this policy are to:

-   Comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other applicable regulations.
-   Protect PHI from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
-   Minimize the impact of security incidents.
-   Establish a culture of security awareness and responsibility.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] will conduct a risk assessment at least annually to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to its information systems and PHI. The risk assessment will:

-   Identify and document assets containing or processing PHI.
-   Identify and document potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of PHI.
-   Assess the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
-   Prioritize risks based on their potential impact.
-   Develop and implement mitigation strategies to address identified risks.
-   Document the risk assessment process and results, including any identified gaps and remediation plans.

Due to the Low risk environment, the risk assessment will focus on readily available threat intelligence and common vulnerabilities, using standardized frameworks where possible. The assessment will be right-sized to the organization, using questionnaires and interviews to gather information from key stakeholders. A formal penetration test is not required but vulnerability scans should be implemented.

### 3. Data Protection

--3.1. Data Encryption:--

All electronic PHI (ePHI) stored at rest on portable devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, USB drives) must be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES 256-bit). Encryption of data at rest on servers and workstations is recommended. Encryption of data in transit over public networks (e.g., the internet) is required, using protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) or VPN (Virtual Private Network).

--3.2. Data Backup and Recovery:--

Regular backups of all critical data, including ePHI, will be performed and stored securely, both on-site and off-site. Backup frequency will be determined based on the criticality of the data and the recovery time objective (RTO). A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested regularly to ensure the ability to restore data in the event of a disaster or system failure.

--3.3. Data Minimization:--

[Organization Name] will collect and retain only the minimum amount of PHI necessary to fulfill its legitimate business purposes. Data retention policies will be established and followed to ensure that PHI is securely disposed of when it is no longer needed.

--3.4. Data Loss Prevention (DLP):--

Basic DLP measures will be implemented to prevent the unauthorized transfer of PHI outside of [Organization Name]'s control. This may include restricting the use of personal email accounts and file-sharing services, and monitoring network traffic for unusual activity.

--3.5. Media Disposal:--

All electronic media containing PHI must be securely erased or physically destroyed before disposal. This includes hard drives, USB drives, and other storage devices.

### 4. Access Controls

--4.1. User Authentication:--

All users must authenticate to access [Organization Name]'s systems and data using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible. Password policies will be enforced, requiring users to create strong passwords that are regularly changed.

--4.2. Access Rights Management:--

Access to PHI will be granted on a "need-to-know" basis, using role-based access control (RBAC). Users will only be granted access to the data and systems that they require to perform their job duties. Access rights will be reviewed and updated regularly.

--4.3. Physical Security:--

Physical access to [Organization Name]'s facilities and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel. Security measures, such as locks, alarms, and surveillance cameras, will be implemented to protect against unauthorized physical access.

--4.4. Remote Access:--

Remote access to [Organization Name]'s systems and data will be secured using VPNs or other secure remote access technologies. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended for remote access.

--4.5. Termination of Access:--

Access to [Organization Name]'s systems and data will be promptly revoked when an employee or contractor leaves the organization or changes roles.

### 5. Incident Response

--5.1. Incident Reporting:--

All security incidents, including suspected breaches of PHI, must be reported immediately to the designated incident response team.

--5.2. Incident Response Plan:--

[Organization Name] will maintain a documented incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident. The plan will include procedures for:

-   Identifying and containing the incident.
-   Assessing the scope and impact of the incident.
-   Notifying affected parties, including regulatory agencies, as required by law.
-   Remediating the vulnerabilities that led to the incident.
-   Documenting the incident and the response.
-   Post-incident review and improvement.

--5.3. Breach Notification:--

In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, [Organization Name] will comply with all applicable breach notification requirements under HIPAA and other relevant regulations.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

--6.1. Training Program:--

All employees, contractors, and other individuals accessing [Organization Name]'s systems and data will receive security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training will cover topics such as:

-   HIPAA compliance requirements.
-   Identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.
-   Creating strong passwords.
-   Protecting PHI from unauthorized access and disclosure.
-   Reporting security incidents.
-   Safe internet and email usage.
-   Social engineering awareness.

--6.2. Training Records:--

Records of security awareness training will be maintained for all individuals.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

--7.1. Compliance Officer:--

A designated Compliance Officer will be responsible for overseeing [Organization Name]'s compliance with HIPAA and other applicable regulations.

--7.2. Audits:--

Regular audits will be conducted to assess [Organization Name]'s compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and relevant regulations. Audits may include:

-   Review of security policies and procedures.
-   Vulnerability scans and penetration testing (risk-based).
-   Review of access controls and user permissions.
-   Review of incident response procedures.
-   Review of security awareness training records.

--7.3. Corrective Action:--

Any identified compliance gaps or security vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly through corrective action.

### 8. Conclusion

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI and other sensitive data held by [Organization Name]. By adhering to this policy, we can minimize the risk of security incidents and comply with HIPAA and other applicable regulations. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or as needed to address changes in the threat landscape or regulatory requirements. All personnel are responsible for understanding and adhering to the principles outlined within this document.
