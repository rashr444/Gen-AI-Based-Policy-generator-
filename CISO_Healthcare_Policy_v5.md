## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the essential security requirements and practices for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data. This policy is designed for a low-risk environment, recognizing that while threats exist, the organization's size, complexity, and data sensitivity allow for a focused and prioritized approach to security. This policy adheres to the principles and guidelines outlined in the Risk Management Framework (RMF). All employees, contractors, and other authorized users are required to comply with this policy. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] will conduct a risk assessment at least annually, or whenever there are significant changes to the organization's infrastructure, systems, or business processes. This assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise ePHI and other sensitive data. The risk assessment methodology will be based on the RMF, focusing on:

-   --Asset Identification:-- Identifying and classifying all assets that store, process, or transmit ePHI.
-   --Threat Identification:-- Identifying potential threats, both internal and external, that could exploit vulnerabilities. Common threats include malware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and physical security breaches.
-   --Vulnerability Assessment:-- Assessing the vulnerabilities present in our systems and infrastructure. This includes reviewing software versions, configurations, and security controls.
-   --Likelihood and Impact Analysis:-- Determining the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the potential impact on the organization if the event occurs. The impact will be assessed in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, as well as legal, financial, and reputational consequences.
-   --Risk Prioritization:-- Prioritizing identified risks based on their likelihood and impact, allowing for the allocation of resources to address the most critical vulnerabilities first.
-   --Risk Response:-- Identify, evaluate, and select risk response options consistent with organizational objectives and risk tolerance.

The results of the risk assessment will be documented and used to inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls.

### 3. Data Protection

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting ePHI and other sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The following measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Encryption:-- ePHI will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys will be securely managed.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Data collection will be limited to the minimum necessary information required to fulfill legitimate business purposes.
-   --Data Retention:-- Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements. Data that is no longer needed will be securely disposed of.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of ePHI and critical systems will be performed and stored securely. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically to ensure the ability to restore data in the event of a disaster or system failure.
-   --Data Integrity:-- Mechanisms to ensure data integrity, such as checksums or hashing, will be implemented where appropriate.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to systems and data centers will be restricted to authorized personnel. Security measures such as locks, alarms, and surveillance cameras will be employed.

### 4. Access Controls

Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be restricted to authorized personnel based on the principle of least privilege. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be required for all users accessing ePHI and critical systems.
-   --Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-- Access to data and systems will be granted based on user roles and responsibilities.
-   --Access Reviews:-- User access privileges will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and terminated as needed. Dormant accounts will be disabled or removed.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access to the organization's network will be provided through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other secure methods, requiring MFA.
-   --Audit Logging:-- All access to ePHI and critical systems will be logged and monitored for suspicious activity.

### 5. Incident Response

[Organization Name] will maintain a documented incident response plan to address security incidents in a timely and effective manner. The plan will include the following elements:

-   --Incident Identification:-- Procedures for identifying and reporting security incidents.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Steps to contain the spread of an incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Eradication:-- Actions to remove the cause of the incident and restore systems to a secure state.
-   --Incident Recovery:-- Procedures for recovering data and systems affected by the incident.
-   --Post-Incident Activity:-- Analysis of the incident to identify lessons learned and improve security controls.
-   --Reporting:-- Procedures for reporting security incidents to appropriate authorities, as required by law or regulation.

The incident response plan will be tested at least annually to ensure its effectiveness.

### 6. Security Awareness Training

All employees, contractors, and other authorized users will receive security awareness training on an annual basis. The training will cover topics such as:

-   --Data Security Basics:-- Principles of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
-   --Phishing Awareness:-- How to identify and avoid phishing attacks.
-   --Password Security:-- Best practices for creating and managing strong passwords.
-   --Social Engineering:-- How to recognize and avoid social engineering attacks.
-   --Malware Awareness:-- How to prevent malware infections.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Procedures for reporting security incidents.
-   --Policy Compliance:-- Understanding and adhering to this Cybersecurity Policy.

Training will be tailored to the roles and responsibilities of different user groups.

### 7. Compliance and Auditing

[Organization Name] will regularly monitor and audit its compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and applicable regulations, including those relevant to RMF. The following measures will be implemented:

-   --Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or whenever there are significant changes to the organization's infrastructure, systems, or business processes.
-   --Vulnerability Scanning:-- Regular vulnerability scans will be conducted to identify potential security weaknesses in our systems and infrastructure.
-   --Penetration Testing:-- Periodic penetration testing will be performed to assess the effectiveness of our security controls.
-   --Audit Trails:-- Audit logs will be regularly reviewed to detect suspicious activity and ensure compliance with policies and procedures.
-   --Compliance Assessments:-- Periodic compliance assessments will be conducted to ensure that we are meeting our regulatory obligations.
