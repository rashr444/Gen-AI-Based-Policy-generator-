```
You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a comprehensive cybersecurity policy framework for an organization that processes personal data of EU citizens. The policy should be robust, practical, and aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The policy framework should cover the following key areas in detail:

--1. Purpose and Scope:--

-   Clearly state the purpose of the policy, which is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including GDPR.
-   Define the scope of the policy, specifying the individuals, systems, locations, and data covered.
-   Define key terms used throughout the policy (e.g., Personal Data, Data Controller, Data Processor, Data Subject, Incident).

--2. Roles and Responsibilities:--

-   Define the roles and responsibilities of key personnel involved in cybersecurity, including:
    -   Data Controller: Responsible for determining the purposes and means of processing personal data.  Outline key responsibilities such as ensuring data protection by design and by default, conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where necessary, and maintaining records of processing activities.
    -   Data Processor: Responsible for processing personal data on behalf of the Data Controller. Outline key responsibilities such as implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing, notifying the Data Controller of any data breaches, and cooperating with the Data Controller in fulfilling its GDPR obligations.
    -   Data Protection Officer (DPO) (if applicable): Responsible for overseeing data protection compliance.
    -   IT Department: Responsible for implementing and maintaining technical security controls.
    -   All Employees: Responsible for adhering to the policy and reporting security incidents.

    -   Purpose limitation: Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
    -   Data minimization: Data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.
    -   Accuracy: Data must be accurate and kept up to date.
    -   Storage limitation: Data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed.
    -   Integrity and confidentiality: Data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.
    -   Accountability: The data controller is responsible for demonstrating compliance with the GDPR.

    -   --Network Security:-- Implement firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and other network security controls to protect against unauthorized access.
    -   --Physical Security:-- Implement physical security measures to protect data centers and other facilities where personal data is stored.
    -   --Vulnerability Management:--
        -   Establish and maintain a vulnerability management program to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

        -   Apply patches in a timely manner, prioritizing critical patches within [Insert Timeframe - e.g., 72 hours], high-severity patches within [Insert Timeframe - e.g., one week], and other patches according to a risk-based approach.
        -   Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact to the organization.
    -   --Data Backups:-- Regularly back up personal data to prevent data loss. Test data backups [Insert Frequency - e.g., monthly] to ensure their integrity and recoverability. Store backups in a secure location, separate from the primary data.

    -   Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling. [Insert Link to instructions on how to exercise this right].

--7. Incident Response:--

-   Establish an incident response plan to address security incidents, including data breaches. The plan should include the following steps:
    -   --Incident Identification:-- Identify and classify security incidents.
    -   --Incident Assessment:-- Assess the scope and impact of the incident.
    -   --Containment:-- Take steps to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
    -   --Eradication:-- Remove the cause of the incident (e.g., malware, vulnerability). This may involve patching systems, updating software, and strengthening security controls.
    -   --Recovery:-- Restore systems and data to their normal operating state.
    -   --Notification:-- Notify affected parties, including data subjects and regulatory authorities (if required). Data breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery, as required by GDPR.
