## Cybersecurity Policy for Low-Risk Financial Environment

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Effective Date:** November 1, 2023
**Author:** [Your Name/CISO Title]
**Approved By:** [Name/Title of Approving Authority]

**1. Introduction**

This Cybersecurity Policy ("Policy") outlines the minimum security standards required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems within [Organization Name]'s low-risk financial environment. This policy is designed to minimize the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of business operations while maintaining a balance between security and operational efficiency. This Policy is aligned with the principles and framework outlined in the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and aims to meet relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations applicable to financial institutions operating in a low-risk capacity.  This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information and systems, regardless of location.

**2. Risk Assessment**

A risk-based approach to cybersecurity is paramount. While this environment is considered low-risk, periodic risk assessments are necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Frequency:** A formal risk assessment will be conducted annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur within the environment (e.g., new systems, new regulations, significant changes in business processes).
*   **Scope:** The risk assessment will consider potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the impact of a security breach on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.
*   **Methodology:** The risk assessment methodology will be consistent with industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) or a simplified version of the RMF appropriate for a low-risk profile.
*   **Documentation:** The results of the risk assessment, including identified vulnerabilities and proposed remediation plans, will be documented and tracked.
*   **Risk Acceptance:**  A formal process for risk acceptance will be in place, whereby identified risks exceeding the acceptable risk threshold are escalated to management for review and decision-making.  Risks accepted must be documented and periodically reviewed.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Implement basic system monitoring tools to log security events and detect anomalies.  Review these logs periodically.

**3. Data Protection**

Protecting sensitive financial data is critical. The following measures will be implemented:

*   **Data Classification:** Data will be classified based on sensitivity and business impact.  For this low-risk environment, a simplified classification scheme of "Public," "Internal," and "Confidential" may be sufficient.
*   **Data Minimization:**  Only collect and retain data that is necessary for legitimate business purposes.
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data at rest (e.g., on hard drives, databases) will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms when technically feasible.  Encryption in transit (e.g., using HTTPS) will be mandatory for all internet-facing applications and systems.
*   **Data Backup and Recovery:**  Regular data backups will be performed to ensure business continuity in the event of a system failure or data loss. Backups will be stored securely and tested periodically to verify recoverability.
*   **Data Disposal:** Data will be securely disposed of when no longer needed, using methods that prevent unauthorized access (e.g., data wiping, physical destruction of storage media).

**4. Access Controls**

Limiting access to sensitive data and systems is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Access to information and systems will be granted only to those individuals who require it to perform their job duties.
*   **Account Management:**  User accounts will be created, managed, and disabled in a timely manner, following established procedures.  Strong password policies will be enforced, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and periodic password changes. Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be implemented wherever technically feasible, especially for privileged accounts.
*   **Remote Access:** Remote access to the organization's network and systems will be secured using VPNs or other secure remote access technologies.
*   **Physical Security:** Physical access to server rooms and other sensitive areas will be restricted to authorized personnel only.

**5. Incident Response**

A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for effectively managing and mitigating security incidents.

*   **Incident Identification and Reporting:**  All employees are responsible for reporting suspected security incidents to [Designated Contact/Team].
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  A documented incident response plan will be maintained, outlining the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.  The plan will include procedures for incident identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Incident Response Team:** An incident response team will be designated, responsible for coordinating and executing the incident response plan. The size and complexity of the team will be appropriate for the low-risk environment.
*   **Incident Communication:** Procedures will be established for communicating with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and regulatory agencies, in the event of a security incident.

**6. Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training is essential to educate employees about cybersecurity risks and best practices.

*   **Frequency:**  All employees will receive initial security awareness training upon hire and annual refresher training.
*   **Content:** Training will cover topics such as phishing awareness, password security, social engineering, data protection, incident reporting, and the importance of adhering to this Cybersecurity Policy.
*   **Delivery Method:** Training can be delivered through a variety of methods, including online modules, classroom training, and simulated phishing attacks.
*   **Record Keeping:** Records of employee training will be maintained.

**7. Compliance and Auditing**

Compliance with this policy will be regularly monitored and audited to ensure effectiveness.

*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in the threat landscape, business operations, or regulatory requirements.
*   **Internal Audits:**  Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy.
*   **External Audits:** External audits may be conducted as required by regulatory agencies or contractual obligations.
*   **Remediation:**  Any identified non-compliance issues will be promptly remediated.

**8. Conclusion**

This Cybersecurity Policy provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems within [Organization Name]'s low-risk financial environment.  Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals accessing or using [Organization Name]'s information and systems.  By working together, we can create a more secure environment and protect our organization from cybersecurity threats. This policy is a living document and will be continuously improved to adapt to the evolving threat landscape. Questions and concerns regarding this policy should be directed to [Designated Contact/Team].
