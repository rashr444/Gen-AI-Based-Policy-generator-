### Cybersecurity Policy for Low Risk Healthcare Environment

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data within this healthcare organization. This policy aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data while adhering to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other applicable regulations. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing or using the organization's information systems and data. As this is defined as a "Low Risk Environment", we acknowledge that while risks exist, we are implementing baseline security measures that are proportionate to the potential impact. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address emerging threats and changes in regulatory requirements.

--2. Risk Assessment--

A risk assessment will be conducted annually, or whenever significant changes occur to the organization's IT infrastructure, applications, or business processes. The assessment will identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to ePHI and other sensitive data, evaluate the likelihood and impact of these risks, and prioritize them for remediation. Given this is a "Low Risk Environment", the assessment will focus on common vulnerabilities such as weak passwords, unpatched software, and phishing attacks. Risk assessments will be documented and reviewed by senior management. Remediation plans will be developed and implemented to address identified risks, with progress tracked and reported regularly. Mitigation strategies will focus on easily implementable and cost-effective solutions.

--3. Data Protection--

-   --Data Encryption:-- ePHI stored on laptops or removable media will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Encryption keys will be securely managed. Data in transit, especially when transmitted outside the organization's network, will also be encrypted.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data, including ePHI, will be performed and stored securely offsite or in a secure cloud environment. Backup procedures will be tested regularly to ensure data can be restored quickly and effectively in the event of a data loss incident. A documented data recovery plan will be maintained and updated annually.
-   --Data Minimization:-- Only the minimum necessary ePHI should be collected, used, and retained for legitimate business purposes. Data retention policies will be established and enforced to ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary.
-   --Data Disposal:-- When data is no longer needed, it will be securely disposed of using approved methods, such as data wiping or physical destruction of storage media.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Given the "Low Risk Environment" designation, DLP measures may be limited to policy enforcement and monitoring of data access and transfer activities, rather than deploying extensive DLP technology.

--4. Access Controls--

-   --User Authentication:-- Strong passwords, with complexity requirements, will be enforced for all user accounts. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be implemented where feasible and practical, especially for privileged accounts. Generic or shared accounts are prohibited.
-   --Authorization:-- Access to ePHI and other sensitive data will be granted on a "need-to-know" basis, following the principle of least privilege. User access rights will be reviewed regularly and adjusted as needed.
-   --Account Management:-- User accounts will be promptly created, modified, and disabled as employees join, change roles, or leave the organization. A formal process for managing user accounts will be maintained.
-   --Physical Access Controls:-- Physical access to facilities and areas where ePHI is stored or processed will be restricted to authorized personnel. Access control mechanisms, such as keycards or badges, will be used. Visitor access will be logged and monitored.
-   --Remote Access:-- Remote access to the organization's network and systems will be secured using VPNs or other secure methods. Remote access policies will be established and enforced.

--5. Incident Response--

-   --Incident Identification:-- A process for identifying and reporting security incidents will be established. All employees are responsible for reporting any suspected security incidents immediately.
-   --Incident Containment:-- Upon detection of a security incident, immediate steps will be taken to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
-   --Incident Investigation:-- A thorough investigation will be conducted to determine the cause and scope of the incident.
-   --Incident Resolution:-- Appropriate steps will be taken to resolve the incident and restore systems to normal operation.
-   --Incident Reporting:-- Security incidents will be reported to relevant authorities, including regulatory agencies, as required by law.
-   --Incident Response Plan:-- A written incident response plan will be maintained and tested regularly. The plan will outline the roles and responsibilities of incident response team members, as well as the procedures for responding to different types of security incidents.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

-   --Training Program:-- All employees will receive annual security awareness training on topics such as phishing, malware, password security, data protection, and incident reporting.
-   --Training Content:-- Training content will be tailored to the organization's specific environment and risks.
-   --Training Delivery:-- Training will be delivered through a variety of methods, such as online modules, classroom sessions, and simulated phishing attacks.
-   --Training Records:-- Records of employee training will be maintained.
-   --Ongoing Awareness:-- Security awareness messages and reminders will be communicated to employees on a regular basis.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

-   --HIPAA Compliance:-- This policy is designed to comply with the requirements of HIPAA. The organization will conduct regular HIPAA compliance audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
-   --Policy Enforcement:-- This policy will be enforced through disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment, for violations.
-   --Policy Review:-- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to address emerging threats and changes in regulatory requirements.
-   --Auditing:-- Regular security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the organization's security controls. Audit findings will be reported to senior management and used to improve security practices.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the organization's data and systems from cyber threats. All employees are responsible for adhering to this policy and contributing to a secure environment. By following the guidelines outlined in this policy, the organization can minimize its risk exposure, maintain compliance with applicable regulations, and protect the privacy of its patients. The "Low Risk Environment" designation should not be interpreted as a lack of importance of security, but rather a commitment to implementing appropriate and proportionate security measures.
