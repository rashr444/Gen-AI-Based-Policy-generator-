## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organizations (Low Risk Environment)

--1. Introduction--

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the mandatory security standards for [Organization Name] ("the Organization"), its employees, contractors, vendors, and any individual or entity accessing, using, or managing the Organization's information systems and data. This policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets, especially Protected Health Information (PHI), while acknowledging the Organization's current classification as a Low Risk environment. While classified as Low Risk, we are committed to proactively managing potential threats and vulnerabilities to maintain a secure operating posture and safeguard sensitive data. This policy aligns with applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices, including SOC 2. Adherence to this policy is required of all personnel and is essential for maintaining trust with our patients and partners.

--2. Risk Assessment--

The Organization will conduct periodic risk assessments, at least annually, to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our information systems and data. These assessments will consider:

-   --Threats:-- Potential events that could harm the organization (e.g., malware, phishing attacks, unauthorized access).
-   --Vulnerabilities:-- Weaknesses in systems or processes that could be exploited by threats (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords).
-   --Impact:-- The potential consequences of a successful attack (e.g., data breach, service disruption).
-   --Likelihood:-- The probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

Even in a Low Risk environment, the risk assessment process will incorporate an assessment of potential new risks. The results of these assessments will inform the development and implementation of appropriate security controls and will be documented and reviewed by senior management. A formal risk register will be maintained. Remediation efforts for identified vulnerabilities will be prioritized based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

--3. Data Protection--

The Organization is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, particularly PHI. The following measures will be implemented:

-   --Data Classification:-- Data will be classified based on its sensitivity and criticality. PHI will be treated as highly sensitive.
-   --Data Encryption:-- Encryption will be used to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit where technically feasible and appropriate, especially when transmitted outside the organization's internal network.
-   --Data Backup and Recovery:-- Regular backups of critical data will be performed, and a documented recovery plan will be maintained and tested periodically. Backups will be stored in a secure location separate from the primary data.
-   --Data Retention and Disposal:-- Data will be retained only for as long as necessary to meet business, legal, and regulatory requirements. Secure data disposal methods will be used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
-   --Data Loss Prevention (DLP):-- Though DLP solutions may not be fully implemented, awareness will be maintained regarding DLP principles, and basic measures will be considered to prevent accidental or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

--4. Access Controls--

Access to information systems and data will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel will be granted access to the information they need to perform their job duties. The following access control measures will be implemented:

-   --User Account Management:-- A formal process will be in place for creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts.
-   --Strong Passwords:-- Users will be required to create strong passwords that meet minimum complexity requirements and change them periodically. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) will be enabled where available and feasible, especially for remote access.
-   --Access Reviews:-- Periodic reviews of user access rights will be conducted to ensure that access remains appropriate.
-   --Physical Security:-- Physical access to facilities and equipment containing sensitive data will be controlled through measures such as badge access, surveillance cameras, and visitor logs.
-   --Remote Access:-- Secure remote access methods, such as VPNs, will be used to protect data transmitted over public networks.

--5. Incident Response--

The Organization will maintain a documented Incident Response Plan (IRP) to effectively respond to and recover from security incidents. The IRP will outline the roles and responsibilities of incident response team members, procedures for identifying, reporting, investigating, and containing security incidents, and steps for restoring affected systems and data. The IRP will be tested and updated periodically. Even in a Low Risk environment, employees will be educated on how to report suspected security incidents. A designated point of contact will be identified for reporting security concerns.

--6. Security Awareness Training--

All employees, contractors, and vendors will receive security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training will cover topics such as:

-   Common cyber threats, including phishing, malware, and social engineering.
-   Data protection policies and procedures.
-   Password security best practices.
-   Incident reporting procedures.
-   Acceptable use of organizational assets.

The training program will be designed to raise awareness of security risks and promote a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.

--7. Compliance and Auditing--

The Organization is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, including SOC 2. The following measures will be implemented to ensure compliance:

-   --SOC 2 Compliance:-- The Organization will adhere to the Trust Services Criteria of SOC 2, focusing on Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy, as applicable to its services and systems.
-   --Regular Audits:-- Periodic internal audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this Cybersecurity Policy and other relevant security standards. External audits will be conducted as required by regulatory bodies or contractual obligations.
-   --Policy Review:-- This Cybersecurity Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, or organizational operations.
-   --Documentation:-- All security-related policies, procedures, and activities will be documented and maintained in a central repository.

--8. Conclusion--

This Cybersecurity Policy is essential for protecting the Organization's information assets and maintaining the trust of our patients and partners. All personnel are responsible for adhering to this policy and reporting any security concerns. While operating in a Low Risk environment, the Organization remains committed to continuous improvement and will adapt its security measures as needed to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Senior management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement and maintain an effective cybersecurity program.
