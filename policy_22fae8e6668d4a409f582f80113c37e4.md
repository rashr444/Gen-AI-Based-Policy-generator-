## Cybersecurity Policy for Healthcare Organization (Low Risk Environment)

### 1. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Policy outlines the minimum-security requirements for [Organization Name] to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive data. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals or entities accessing [Organization Name]'s systems and data. It is designed to establish a security baseline commensurate with our identified low-risk environment while adhering to relevant compliance standards, specifically SOC 2.

This policy is a living document and will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in technology, threats, regulatory requirements, and business operations. All users are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

### 2. Risk Assessment

[Organization Name] conducts regular risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities to our systems and data. Given our determination as a low-risk environment, these assessments will focus on identifying readily addressable threats and vulnerabilities with minimal business impact.

Risk assessments will include, but are not limited to:

-   --Annual Security Review:-- A comprehensive review of existing security controls, policies, and procedures.

-   --Threat Monitoring:-- Implementation of basic security monitoring tools and processes to detect suspicious activity.
-   --Third-Party Risk Management:-- Due diligence reviews of third-party vendors with access to sensitive data, focusing on their adherence to security best practices.

Identified risks will be documented, prioritized based on likelihood and impact, and addressed through appropriate mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies may include implementing technical controls, improving security policies and procedures, or accepting the risk based on cost-benefit analysis and business requirements.

### 3. Data Protection

[Organization Name] is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all data, especially PHI. This policy mandates the following data protection measures:
